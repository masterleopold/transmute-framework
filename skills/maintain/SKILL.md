# Dependency Maintenance — Stage 9

## Context

Designed to be run on a regular cadence (monthly or quarterly) to keep the codebase healthy. Outdated dependencies accumulate security vulnerabilities, miss performance improvements, and eventually create painful migration cliffs.

## Prerequisites

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` and `plancasting/tech-stack.md`.
2. Ensure `git status` shows a clean working directory. Commit or stash all uncommitted changes.
3. Check `plancasting/tech-stack.md` for the `Session Language` setting. Generate all reports in the specified language.
4. Infer package manager from lock files if CLAUDE.md Part 2 'Commands' section is empty: `bun.lockb` -> bun, `package-lock.json` -> npm, `pnpm-lock.yaml` -> pnpm. Log the inferred package manager in the report.

## Inputs

- **Codebase**: Complete project directory
- **Tech Stack**: `./plancasting/tech-stack.md`
- **Project Rules**: `./CLAUDE.md`
- **Lock file**: `package-lock.json`, `bun.lockb`, or `pnpm-lock.yaml`

## Stack Adaptation

Examples use `bun` commands. Adapt to your package manager:
- `npm audit` -> Bun has no built-in audit. Use `npm audit` if `package-lock.json` exists; otherwise use `bunx audit-ci` or `npx snyk test`. Document which audit tool was used in the report.
- `npm update` -> `bun update`
- `npm outdated` -> `bunx npm-check-updates` (Bun has no built-in `outdated` command)
Always read `CLAUDE.md` and `plancasting/tech-stack.md` for actual conventions.

## Execution Flow

### Phase 1: Lead Analysis and Planning

**Branch safety**: Create a dedicated branch: `git checkout -b chore/dependency-update-$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S)`. The HMS suffix prevents collisions if Stage 9 is re-run the same day. Do NOT commit directly to main.

**Pre-flight Concurrency Check**: Before proceeding, verify that Stage 8 (Feedback Loop) is not currently in progress. Check: (1) `git log --oneline -5 | grep -i 'feedback'` — if the most recent commit is an in-progress feedback batch from the current day, STOP; (2) `git branch --list 'feedback/*'` — if a `feedback/batch-*` branch exists, Stage 8 may be active. Do not run Stage 9 concurrently with Stage 8 (both modify `package.json` and lock files). Wait for Stage 8 to complete and commit before starting Stage 9.

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` and `plancasting/tech-stack.md`.
2. Verify clean working directory.
3. Create maintenance directory: `mkdir -p ./plancasting/_maintenance`
4. Record the current baseline:
   ```bash
   bun run typecheck
   bun run lint
   bun run test
   bun run test:e2e
   bun run build
   ```
   Save results to `./plancasting/_maintenance/baseline-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md`. If baseline tests show NEW regressions (not pre-existing), STOP -- resolve regressions before proceeding. Compare test results against the last green CI run or previous commit's output. Document any pre-existing failures in the baseline.

5. Analyze current dependencies:
   ```bash
   bunx npm-check-updates > ./plancasting/_maintenance/outdated.txt
   # Security audit (choose based on lock file)
   if [ -f bun.lockb ]; then
     bunx audit-ci > ./plancasting/_maintenance/audit.json
   elif [ -f package-lock.json ]; then
     npm audit --json > ./plancasting/_maintenance/audit.json
   elif [ -f pnpm-lock.yaml ]; then
     pnpm audit --json > ./plancasting/_maintenance/audit.json
   fi
   ```
   If no outdated dependencies and no vulnerabilities, generate a brief all-clear report and exit early.

6. **Categorize updates into tiered batches**:
   - **Security patches** (any severity): MUST update. Sub-classify by CVSS severity if available: CRITICAL (9-10) = patch immediately, can trigger emergency Stage 9; HIGH (7-8) = patch within 24-48 hours; MEDIUM (4-6) = patch in current run; LOW (0-3) = patch in next planned run. Process CRITICAL patches in a dedicated fast-tracked batch before other updates.
   - **Patch versions** (x.y.Z): Low risk, usually safe -- BUT verify the changelog first
   - **Minor versions** (x.Y.z): Medium risk, may add features or deprecations
   - **Major versions** (X.y.z): High risk, likely breaking changes

7. Create `./plancasting/_maintenance/update-plan.md` with ordered updates (security first, then patch, minor, major). For major versions, search for migration guides and breaking change notes. If web search is unavailable, check `node_modules/<package>/CHANGELOG.md`. Include risk assessment per update (scale 1-5): 1 = security patch, zero API changes; 5 = major version with significant architectural changes.

8. Create task list for teammates.

### Phase 2: Spawn Maintenance Teammates

Spawn 3 teammates SEQUENTIALLY (low risk -> medium -> high risk). **Rationale**: Security patches may change APIs that affect minor version compatibility; minor updates must land before major upgrades.

**Teammate 1 -- "security-and-patch-updater"**: Apply security patches and patch version updates. For each vulnerability: update to patched version or research alternatives. Run typecheck, test, and lint after each batch. Run test:e2e if updates touch auth libraries, HTTP clients, or test frameworks. **Lock file stability check** (Bun only): After `bun install`, run `bun install` again -- should be idempotent (no changes). If lock file changes on second install, dependency resolution is unstable -- investigate.

**Teammate 2 -- "minor-version-updater"** (BLOCKED by Teammate 1): Apply minor version updates. Check changelogs for deprecations and behavioral changes. Handle environment variable changes (update `.env.local.example`, NEVER commit `.env.local`). Replace deprecated API usage. Run verification after each update. If Playwright was updated, run `bunx playwright install --with-deps` before E2E tests.

**Teammate 3 -- "major-version-updater"** (BLOCKED by Teammate 2): Apply major version updates ONE AT A TIME. Follow migration guides. Run full verification suite (typecheck, lint, test, test:e2e, build) after EACH major update. Handle framework updates with extra care (check config file changes). **Backend SDK codegen re-run requirement**: When updating any backend SDK, re-run code generation IMMEDIATELY and UNCONDITIONALLY after `bun install` but BEFORE tests:
- **Convex**: `bunx convex codegen` (regenerates `convex/_generated/`)
- **Prisma**: `npx prisma generate` (regenerates Prisma Client). If schema changed: `npx prisma migrate dev`
- **Drizzle**: No codegen required, but review `schema.ts` for type compatibility
- **Supabase**: Run `supabase gen types typescript` if using type generation
- **Firebase Admin SDK**: No codegen required, but verify function signatures

**Codegen is a GATE**: Generated files and runtime SDK versions must stay in sync -- tests WILL fail with type mismatches if codegen is not run first. If codegen fails, revert the update and mark as deferred.

If a major update is too complex to resolve, revert and document.

### Phase 3: Coordination

Monitor progress. Enforce sequential dependency. Help research breaking changes.

### Phase 4: Final Verification and Report

1. Run COMPLETE test suite. Compare to baseline.
2. **Runtime version check**: If major updates changed `engines` requirements, verify Node.js/Bun version compatibility. If runtime does NOT satisfy new requirements: update local runtime, update CI/CD pipeline, or revert the dependency update.
3. Re-run security audit. Compare to baseline.
4. Generate `./plancasting/_maintenance/report-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md`:
   - Updates applied (security, patch, minor, major counts)
   - Deferred updates with rationale
   - Test results: baseline vs post-update
   - Security audit: before vs after vulnerability count
   - Recommendations for future updates
   - Rules hygiene (populated in step 9)
   - Next maintenance date suggestion. Default: 30 days. Accelerate if: (1) critical vulnerabilities exist, (2) breaking changes deferred, (3) major framework updates pending
5. **Stage 6V/7D re-run decision**: If major updates touched React, Next.js, Tailwind, CSS framework, or UI component library, add to report: "Recommend re-running Stage 6V to validate UI rendering."
6. Update `plancasting/tech-stack.md` with new version numbers for core dependencies.
7. Update CLAUDE.md Part 2 if major framework versions changed.
8. Note affected features in `plancasting/_progress.md` if behavioral code changes were made.
9. **Path-scoped rules staleness review**: Read all rule files in `.claude/rules/`. Remove rules referencing deprecated APIs, removed packages, renamed functions, or non-existent file paths. Remove stale candidates from `plancasting/_rules-candidates.md` (pending 2+ maintenance cycles without promotion). Log all changes in the report under a "Rules Hygiene" section:
   ```markdown
   ## Rules Hygiene
   - Rules reviewed: [n]
   - Rules removed: [n] (list reasons)
   - Rules updated: [n] (list changes)
   - Rules unchanged: [n]
   ```
10. **Complete Gate Decision BEFORE merging**. If PASS or CONDITIONAL PASS, merge: `git checkout main && git merge chore/dependency-update-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS`. If merge fails due to lock file conflicts, rebase, reinstall, re-verify, retry.
11. Output summary.

## Gate Decision

- **PASS**: All tests pass post-update, no remaining critical/high vulnerabilities, build succeeds. Proceed to deployment and Stage 7V.
- **CONDITIONAL PASS**: Tests pass but some major updates deferred. Schedule follow-up.
- **FAIL**: Test suite fails and cannot be resolved, or critical vulnerabilities remain unpatched. Do NOT merge to main. Fix failing tests or revert problematic updates. Re-run Phase 4 verification.

**Post-gate routing**:
- **PASS**: Merge, deploy via Stage 7, verify with Stage 7V.
- **CONDITIONAL PASS**: Merge and deploy resolved updates. Schedule follow-up Stage 9 for deferred major updates.
- **FAIL**: Do NOT merge. Fix or revert. Re-run verification.

## Known Failure Patterns

1. **Peer dependency conflicts**: Package A requires React 18, Package B requires React 19. Find compatible versions first; AVOID `--legacy-peer-deps`. **Resolution flowchart**: (1) Do versions overlap? Update to higher. (2) Can one be downgraded? Downgrade less-critical. (3) Substitute available? Switch packages. (4) Last resort: document, add `--legacy-peer-deps` with rationale.
2. **Lock file regeneration**: NEVER delete the lock file. See Lock File Strategy below.
3. **Type definition mismatches**: ALWAYS update `@types/*` alongside runtime packages.
4. **PostCSS/Tailwind breakage**: CSS toolchain is fragile across versions (especially Tailwind v4). Test styling thoroughly after CSS-related updates.
5. **Backend SDK updates**: May require schema migration or codegen re-runs (see Teammate 3 instructions).
6. **Build-only breakage**: Tests pass but production build fails. ALWAYS run `build` after major updates.
7. **Node.js/Bun version requirements**: New versions may require newer runtime.
8. **Environment variable changes**: Auth/payment SDK updates may rename env vars.
9. **Playwright browser binary mismatch**: Run `bunx playwright install --with-deps` after updating Playwright.

## `.claude/rules/` Staleness Review

During each maintenance run, review all path-scoped rules for staleness:
1. Read all rule files in `.claude/rules/`.
2. For each rule, check: deprecated API reference? Removed package? Renamed function? Non-existent file paths? Tech stack changed since rule was generated? Issue structurally resolved by framework upgrade?
3. Remove or update stale rules. Log changes in the report.
4. Review `plancasting/_rules-candidates.md`: Remove candidates pending 2+ maintenance cycles without promotion.

## Monorepo Adaptation

If the project uses workspaces (npm/yarn/pnpm workspaces, Turborepo, Nx):
- Update ROOT `package.json` and lock file first
- Update shared/library workspace packages before consumer packages (e.g., `packages/shared` before `packages/web`)
- Update consumer workspace packages last
- Verify consistent versions across workspaces: `npm list [package-name]`
- **Yarn workspaces**: `yarn workspaces foreach --all run test` (Yarn 3+)
- **pnpm workspaces**: `pnpm -r run test`

## Lock File Strategy

- NEVER delete the lock file to resolve conflicts. Lock file deletion creates unpredictable transitive dependency changes.
- Instead: (1) identify the conflicting package, (2) downgrade or upgrade that specific package, (3) run install to update the lock file.
- For `bun.lockb` (binary): cannot be manually edited -- regenerated by `bun install` after resolving conflicts in `package.json`. Do NOT attempt manual edits.
- For `package-lock.json` or `pnpm-lock.yaml` (text): resolve conflicting entries directly, then reinstall.
- Commit the updated lock file after each successful update batch.
- For `bun.lockb`, verify integrity:
  1. Record hash before update: `{ shasum -a 256 2>/dev/null || sha256sum; } < bun.lockb`
  2. After `bun install`, run `bun install` again (should be idempotent)
  3. If lock file changes on second install, dependency resolution is unstable -- investigate
- Only as absolute last resort (after all strategies exhausted): delete, fresh install, document in report, flag for architecture review.

## Running Cadence

- **Monthly**: Products with strict security requirements or rapidly evolving dependencies.
- **Quarterly**: Most products in active development.
- **On trigger**: When `npm audit` reports a critical vulnerability.

Each run produces a report in `./plancasting/_maintenance/` with the date, building a maintenance history.

## Cross-Stage References

- UI regressions from updates: run **Stage 6V** (Visual & Functional Verification).
- After deploying updates: run **Stage 7V** (Production Smoke Verification).
- User-reported issues from dependency changes: process through **Stage 8** (Feedback Loop).
- If UI component library or styling framework updated: consider re-running **Stage 6D** (developer docs) if they reference the old API, and **Stage 7D** (user guide) to recapture screenshots.

## Critical Rules

1. NEVER update all dependencies at once -- batch by risk tier (security -> patch -> minor -> major).
2. AVOID `--legacy-peer-deps` to force-resolve conflicts. Document if absolutely necessary with rationale: (1) conflict between uncontrolled packages, (2) tested together without issues, (3) no CVE for mismatched versions. Note: `--legacy-peer-deps` is npm-specific. Bun handles peers differently; pnpm uses `--strict-peer-dependencies=false`.
3. NEVER delete the lock file to resolve conflicts.
4. ALWAYS commit to the maintenance branch after each successful tier for granular rollback.
5. ALWAYS run `build` (not just `test`) after major updates.
6. ALWAYS run `lint` after updates -- new plugin versions may introduce rules.
7. Re-run backend code generation IMMEDIATELY and UNCONDITIONALLY after backend SDK updates (e.g., `bunx convex codegen`). Codegen is a GATE -- do not run tests before codegen.
8. For major framework updates, recommend re-running Stage 6V.
9. After deploying, run Stage 7V.
10. Co-dependent packages must be updated together (e.g., `react` + `@types/react`, all `@radix-ui/*`).
11. NEVER run Stage 9 and Stage 8 concurrently. Complete one and commit before starting the other.
