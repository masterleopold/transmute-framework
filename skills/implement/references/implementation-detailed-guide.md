# Transmute — Feature Implementation Orchestrator

## Stage 5: Automated Full-Product Development

### Full-Build Approach (No Phased Delivery)

````text
You are a tech lead orchestrating the implementation of a COMPLETE product using Claude Code Agent Teams. Your job is to read the PRD, identify ALL features, and systematically implement every one of them — including backend, frontend, and tests — with quality gates between features and a final full-product integration verification.

**Stage Sequence**: Business Plan → 0 (Tech Stack) → 1 (BRD) → 2 (PRD) → 2B (Spec Validation) → 3+4 (Scaffold + CLAUDE.md) → **5 (this stage)** → 5B (Audit) → 6A/6B/6C (parallel) → 6E → 6F → 6G → 6D → 6H → 6V → 6R → 6P/6P-R → 7 (Deploy) → 7V → 7D → 8 (Feedback) / 9 (Maintenance)

## Critical Framing: Full-Build Approach

You are building the COMPLETE product. Every feature in the PRD is implemented in this run — no MVP gate, no phased delivery, no feature deferral. The goal is a fully functional product with ALL features working, tested, and integrated.

Features are implemented in dependency order (P0 → P1 → P2 → P3), but ALL priority levels are built. P0–P3 determines the build ORDER, not the build SCOPE — all features are built to completion in this session. If Stage 5B audit later identifies systemic gaps (6+ Category C issues, OR 6+ total unfixed issues across all categories combined, OR any single feature reports FAIL-RETRY three consecutive times across separate 5B runs, triggering automatic per-feature escalation to FAIL-ESCALATE — see Stage 5B prompt for the full threshold table), the lead must re-run Stage 5 for those specific features — but features are never skipped, only reworked. When you reach the end of the queue, the product is complete.

## Post-Implementation Quality Gate

After this stage completes, Stage 5B (Implementation Completeness Audit) will scan ALL features for:
- Stub text patterns ("Coming soon", "PLACEHOLDER", "TODO [Stage 5]", "⚠️ STUB")
- Unconnected hooks (components that import but don't use data)
- Missing loading/error/empty states
- Orphan components (scaffolded but never imported by any page)
- Inline page bloat (pages implementing UI instead of composing scaffold components)

To minimize rework in 5B:
1. ALWAYS implement all component states (loading, error, empty, data)
2. NEVER use hardcoded mock data in components that should query the backend
3. NEVER leave onClick/onSubmit handlers as no-ops (`onClick={() => {}}`)
4. ALWAYS import and compose scaffold components — do NOT rebuild UI inline in pages
5. NEVER create orphan components — verify each component is imported before moving to the next feature

**Clarification**: "Full-build" means ALL features ship — there is no "Phase 1 MVP" within a session. However, context window management (splitting work across multiple sessions) is a *session-level* concern, not a feature-level concern. If a feature requires creating or substantially modifying more than ~15 files total, split it into sub-features for manageability — but ALL sub-features must still be completed. **Timing**: During Phase 0 (before spawning any teammates), the lead reviews each feature's PRD scope. If a feature requires 15+ files total (backend + frontend + tests), mark it for sub-splitting in `_progress.md` BEFORE creating feature briefs. Sub-features should be tracked as separate rows in `plancasting/_progress.md` with IDs like `FEAT-003a`, `FEAT-003b`. Each sub-feature goes through the full Step 1–5 cycle independently. The parent feature is marked Done only when all sub-features are Done. **Sub-feature tracking**: If a feature is split (e.g., FEAT-003a + FEAT-003b), each sub-feature gets its own row in `_progress.md` with the parent noted in the Notes column. The parent feature (FEAT-003) is marked ✅ Done only when ALL sub-features are ✅ Done. If a sub-feature (e.g., FEAT-003a) is blocked, mark it ⏸ separately — the parent status follows: if any sub is ⏸ or 🔧, the parent is 🔧; only when all subs are ✅ is the parent ✅. **Splitting strategy**: Split by screen if the feature has 3+ distinct screens (e.g., TaskList + TaskDetail + TaskCreate = 3 sub-features), by layer if backend is complex (e.g., query logic + mutations as separate sub-features), or by user journey if the feature spans workflows. If you discover mid-implementation that a feature needs 15+ files, pause and notify the lead — do NOT self-split during execution.

## Known Failure Patterns

Based on observed Plan Cast outcomes:

1. **Frontend stubs surviving quality gates**: As the session progresses and context window fills, frontend components become progressively shallower. The last 5-10 features are most at risk. ALWAYS apply the anti-stub quality gates even when fatigued. **Quality gate criteria**: (1) Zero `⚠️ STUB:` markers or TODO comments in new code, (2) all components have loading/error/empty states, (3) all hooks are used (no orphans), (4) all tests pass, (5) no TypeScript or linter errors. Document the gate result (PASS/FAIL) in the feature brief before marking feature done.
2. **Hook data shape mismatch**: Frontend hook expects `{ organizations: [] }` but backend returns `{ items: [] }`. ALWAYS verify the hook's return type matches the actual backend response.
3. **Missing empty/error states**: Agent implements the happy-path render but skips loading, empty, and error states. The quality gate at Step 5 MUST catch these BEFORE marking the feature done — do NOT defer to Stage 5B.
4. **Context window degradation**: Degradation onset occurs around the session feature limit (see tech-stack.md § Model Specifications). Monitor quality gate pass rates — if the last 3+ features show increasing stub rates or missing states, end the session and resume fresh. **Quality degradation threshold**: If 3+ consecutive features have >5 stub/TODO markers each, or if quality gate FAIL occurs twice in sequence, end the session. Start a fresh session and re-paste the prompt — the orchestrator will resume from `_progress.md`. **Session recovery**: The orchestrator maintains `./plancasting/_progress.md` with feature status. When starting a new session, it reads this file, skips ✅ Done features, and resumes from the first incomplete feature. Commit `_progress.md` after each feature completion for clean recovery.
5. **Inline page code instead of component composition**: Frontend teammate writes all UI directly in page.tsx instead of importing scaffold components. ALWAYS check scaffold files before writing new code.
6. **Orphan scaffold components**: Frontend teammate creates new inline components in page files instead of implementing existing scaffold components (see `plancasting/_scaffold-manifest.md` if it exists, otherwise refer to the scaffold directory listing). Result: duplicate UI code and orphan files that Stage 5B must detect.
7. **Backend function signature mismatch**: Backend teammate implements a mutation with different argument names than what the PRD API spec defines — frontend teammate then writes hooks using the PRD names, causing runtime type errors.
8. **Missing cross-feature regression tests**: Feature B depends on Feature A's data, but no regression test verifies Feature A still works after Feature B modifies shared state.
9. **E2E test assumes specific data order**: Test expects items in creation order but the backend query returns them sorted differently — test passes with 1 item but fails intermittently with multiple items.
10. **Auth helper usage inconsistency**: Some backend functions use `requireAuth` while others do manual token extraction — creates inconsistent error responses and missed permission checks.
11. **Circular feature dependencies**: Feature A blocks B, B blocks C, C requires A — forming a cycle. If detected during queue building, STOP and split the feature with the most inbound dependencies in the cycle: separate its Core functionality (no blocking dependency) from its Extension (the part that depends on the blocker). Assign sub-IDs (e.g., `FEAT-003-core`, `FEAT-003-ext`), reorder the queue so Core runs first, then the blocker, then Extension. Update `_progress.md` and request operator approval of the split before proceeding. If detected mid-implementation (a blocked feature's blocker is itself blocked), mark all features in the cycle as ⏸ Blocked, document the cycle in `_progress.md` Notes column, and escalate: the PRD may need scope clarification before these features can proceed.

## Input

- **PRD**: `./plancasting/prd/` (especially `02-feature-map-and-prioritization.md` for the feature inventory and dependency order)
- **BRD**: `./plancasting/brd/` (for business rules and constraints)
- **Business Plan**: `./plancasting/businessplan/` (for domain context when needed)
- **Tech Stack**: `./plancasting/tech-stack.md` (for technology-specific patterns and constraints)
- **Existing Codebase**: The project scaffolding already exists in [your backend directory] (e.g., `./convex/`), [your frontend directory] (e.g., `./src/`), and `./e2e/`.
- **Project Rules**: `./CLAUDE.md` (MUST be read and followed for all code generation)
- **Progress Tracker**: `./plancasting/_progress.md` (tracks ALL features — every one must reach ✅ Done)
- **Code Generation Context**: `./plancasting/_codegen-context.md` (Stage 3's code generation map — should always exist for Stage 3+ projects)
- **Scaffold Manifest**: `./plancasting/_scaffold-manifest.md` (Stage 3's component-to-page mapping — if it exists)

## Prerequisite Verification (BEFORE any other steps)

1. Verify `./plancasting/prd/` directory exists and contains PRD markdown files. If missing → STOP: "Stage 5 requires completed PRD (Stage 2). Run Stage 2 first."
2. Verify `./plancasting/tech-stack.md` exists. If missing → STOP: "Stage 5 requires `plancasting/tech-stack.md` from Stage 0."
3. Verify `./plancasting/_progress.md` exists (created by Stage 3 scaffold). If missing → STOP: "Stage 5 requires Stage 3 scaffolding. Run Stage 3 first."
4. Verify `./CLAUDE.md` exists and Part 2 is populated (Stage 4). If Part 2 still contains only placeholder text → STOP: "Stage 5 requires Stage 4 CLAUDE.md setup."
5. Verify `./plancasting/_scaffold-manifest.md` exists and contains a "Backend Functions" section and a "Components → Page Mapping" section (Stage 3 output). If missing → STOP: "Stage 5 requires the scaffold manifest from Stage 3. Run Stage 3 first or create the manifest manually." If the manifest exists but is incomplete (e.g., missing the Components → Page Mapping section) → WARN and extend it by scanning project directories: list all component files and map them to the pages that import them. Append to the existing manifest — do NOT regenerate from scratch, as that would lose Stage 3's original component list and cause Stage 5B's orphan detection to miss genuinely orphaned files.
6. Verify `./plancasting/_codegen-context.md` exists (Stage 3 output). If missing → WARN: "Code generation context not found — scaffold manifest will be used as fallback for file mapping." Do not STOP; proceed using `_scaffold-manifest.md` as the primary file structure reference.

**Stage 5B Gate**: After Stage 5 completes, Stage 5B (Implementation Completeness Audit) will audit ALL features for stubs, missing states, and integration gaps. Features that fail 5B may be marked `🔄 Needs Re-implementation` in `_progress.md`, requiring you to re-run Stage 5 for those specific features. Stage 5 features are NOT "done" until 5B audits them.

**Session Limit**: A single session can handle the number of features specified in tech-stack.md § Model Specifications "Session feature limit" (default: 25 features if not specified in tech-stack.md) before quality degrades. If the product exceeds that limit, plan for multiple Stage 5 sessions. After each session: commit `_progress.md`, exit, start a fresh `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` session, and paste this prompt again — the orchestrator will resume from the first incomplete feature.

### Output Deliverables

Stage 5 generates the following artifacts:
- **Updated `./plancasting/_progress.md`**: Feature status table updated after each feature completes (⬜ → 🔧 → ✅)
- **Git commits**: One commit per completed feature (type: `feat`)
- **`./plancasting/_implementation-report.md`** (optional but recommended): Summary of implementation decisions, assumptions made, and deviations from PRD — consumed by Stage 5B as input
- **Source code**: All feature implementation files per PRD specifications

### Session Recovery

If resuming from a prior incomplete Stage 5 session:
1. Read `./plancasting/_progress.md` — skip all `✅ Done` features
2. Resume using **positional scan** (top-to-bottom, NOT status-priority): scan `_progress.md` from top to bottom, skip `✅ Done` and `⏸ Blocked` features. The first non-skippable feature encountered is processed: `🔧` = resume from incomplete layer, `🔄` = rebuild from scratch, `⬜` = start fresh. Do NOT search all `🔧` before all `🔄` — process them in the order they appear.
3. If `./plancasting/_implementation-report.md` exists from a prior session, append to it (do not overwrite)

For full session recovery procedure, see the "Session Recovery" section at the end of this document.

## Stack Adaptation

**Package Manager**: Commands in this prompt use `bun run` / `bunx` as the default. Replace with your project's package manager as specified in `CLAUDE.md` or `plancasting/tech-stack.md` (e.g., `npm run` / `npx`, `pnpm run` / `pnpm dlx`, `yarn`).

The examples and file paths in this prompt use Convex + Next.js as the reference architecture. If your `plancasting/tech-stack.md` specifies a different stack, adapt all references accordingly:
- `convex/` → your backend directory
- `convex/schema.ts` → your schema/migration files
- Convex functions (query/mutation/action) → your backend functions/endpoints
- ConvexError → your error handling pattern
- `useQuery`/`useMutation` → your data fetching hooks
- `bunx convex dev` → your backend dev command
- `src/app/` → your frontend pages directory
- SSR data loading: `preloadQuery` (Convex + Next.js App Router) / `loader` (Remix) / `load` (SvelteKit) / framework-specific pattern per `plancasting/tech-stack.md`
Always read `CLAUDE.md` Part 2 (Backend Rules, Frontend Rules) for your project's actual conventions.

## Execution Model

### Startup Sequence

1. Read `./CLAUDE.md` — internalize all conventions, naming rules, and patterns.
2. Read `./plancasting/tech-stack.md` — understand the technology stack and its constraints. Check the `Session Language` setting — use this language for all user-facing output (progress summaries, review checkpoint messages, implementation reports). Code and code comments remain in English.
3. **Credential validation**: Check `.env.local` for any remaining placeholder values (`YOUR_*_HERE`, `TODO_*`, `CHANGE_ME`, `PLACEHOLDER`). If ANY placeholder credentials exist, STOP immediately and list which credentials are missing. Do NOT proceed with feature implementation until all credentials are real values — features that connect to external services (auth, database, email, payments, AI) will fail with placeholders.
4. **Scaffold validation**: Verify `./plancasting/_scaffold-manifest.md` exists (created by Stage 3). If missing, STOP: "Stage 3 scaffold not found — run Stage 3 before Stage 5." Also verify `./plancasting/_audits/spec-validation/report.md` exists and shows PASS or CONDITIONAL PASS (Stage 2B gate). If missing or FAIL, STOP: "Stage 2B must pass before implementation."
   Verify `./plancasting/_briefs/` directory exists. If missing, create it: `mkdir -p ./plancasting/_briefs/`.
5. Read `./plancasting/prd/02-feature-map-and-prioritization.md` — build the complete feature queue.
6. Read `./plancasting/_progress.md` — determine which features are done, in-progress, or pending.
   **CLAUDE.md Part 2 Validation**: Before evaluating feature status, verify CLAUDE.md Part 2 (Project-Specific Configuration) is fully populated — no `[PLACEHOLDER]`, `[N]`, or `[e.g.,` markers remain. If unfilled markers found, STOP: 'Run Stage 4 (CLAUDE.md Verification) to populate Part 2 before starting Stage 5.'

   **5B Re-run Detection**: If `plancasting/_audits/implementation-completeness/report.md` exists (indicating this is a Stage 5 RE-RUN after 5B), scan `_progress.md` for features marked `🔄 Needs Re-implementation`. These are the ONLY features to work on in this session. Skip all `✅ Done` features.

   **Session Recovery Check** — evaluate `plancasting/_progress.md` status using this table (evaluate top to bottom, take the first match):

   | Condition | Action |
   |---|---|
   | Any feature is `🔧 In Progress` | Resume that feature from its first incomplete layer (crashed session recovery) |
   | Any feature is `🔄 Needs Re-implementation` | Resume from that feature (post-5B re-implementation) |
   | Any feature is `⏸ Blocked` | Check if blocker is now `✅ Done` — if yes, change to `🔧 In Progress` and resume; if still blocked, skip and continue to next actionable feature |
   | All features `✅ Done` AND valid report exists | Run Full-Product Completion Sequence |
   | All features `✅ Done` AND report is truncated | Regenerate report, then Full-Product Completion Sequence |
   | All features `✅ Done` AND no report exists | Generate report from scratch, then Full-Product Completion Sequence |
   | Mixed `✅`/`⬜` state | Resume from first `⬜ Not Started` feature |

   **Details**: "Valid report" = `plancasting/_implementation-report.md` contains a 'Launch Readiness Assessment' section. "Truncated" = file exists but lacks that section. For `⏸ Blocked` features, check if the blocker (noted in 'Notes' column) is now `✅ Done` — if yes, change status to `🔧 In Progress`. When all features are `✅ Done` and a valid report exists, output: 'Stage 5 is complete — all features implemented and implementation report generated. Proceed to Stage 5B (Implementation Completeness Audit).' and terminate.
7. Read `./plancasting/_scaffold-manifest.md` (if it exists) — understand the scaffold's file structure, component-to-page mapping, and hook-to-component mapping. This informs feature briefs and prevents duplicate file creation.
8. Read `./plancasting/_codegen-context.md` (Stage 3's code generation map) — understand the full file structure and naming conventions established during scaffolding. This file maps features to their generated files and informs implementation decisions.

   **Manifest File Distinction**: `_codegen-context.md` maps each feature ID to its generated FILES (FEAT-001 → convex/auth.ts, src/components/features/auth/LoginForm.tsx). `_scaffold-manifest.md` maps COMPONENTS to PAGES that import them, plus backend functions by domain. Use _codegen-context to understand the full file structure; use _scaffold-manifest to prevent creating duplicate components and to verify import relationships.
9. Build the **Feature Implementation Queue**:
   - Include ALL features (P0 through P3) — nothing excluded.
   - Sort by development priority: P0 first (foundational), then P1 (primary value), then P2 (enhancing), then P3 (polish).
   - Within each priority level, respect the dependency graph.
   - **Cross-feature dependencies**: Perform a topological sort across the full queue, respecting both priority order AND transitive dependency chains. If Feature C (P2) depends on Feature B (P1) which depends on Feature A (P0), all three must appear in A→B→C order regardless of priority grouping. If a dependency cycle exists, document it and resolve by splitting one feature into two parts. For single-hop cross-priority dependencies: implement the dependency first (re-order within the queue) OR scaffold a mock data provider pending its full implementation. Document any re-ordering decisions in `_progress.md` Notes column.
   - Count total features. This is the target: all must reach ✅ Done.
10. Read `./plancasting/prd/02-feature-map-and-prioritization.md` cross-feature interaction matrix (if present) — note which features interact with each other.

### Feature Implementation Cycle

For each feature in the queue, execute the following cycle:

---

#### Step 1: Feature Analysis (Lead only, BEFORE spawning teammates)

Update `./plancasting/_progress.md` to mark this feature as `🔧 In Progress` before beginning implementation.

Read all PRD/BRD sections relevant to this feature:
- User stories (`./plancasting/prd/04-epics-and-user-stories.md`) — filter to stories for this feature
- Screen specifications (`./plancasting/prd/08-screen-specifications.md`) — filter to screens for this feature
- API/function specifications (`./plancasting/prd/12-api-specifications.md`) — filter to endpoints for this feature
- Business rules (`./plancasting/brd/14-business-rules-and-logic.md`) — filter to rules affecting this feature
- Security requirements (`./plancasting/brd/13-security-requirements.md`) — filter to requirements for this feature
- User flows (`./plancasting/prd/06-user-flows.md`) — identify flows that touch this feature
- Interaction patterns (`./plancasting/prd/09-interaction-patterns.md`) — identify interaction behaviors for this feature's UI

Additionally, for the full-build approach:
- Identify cross-feature dependencies: does this feature consume data from already-completed features? Does it produce data that later features will consume?
- Identify cross-feature integration points: are there already-implemented features whose behavior changes now that this feature is being added?
- Check if any previously completed features need minor updates to integrate with this feature. Minor updates: <30 lines (e.g., add an import, call a new hook, add a list item). If >30 lines of changes are needed in an already-completed feature, escalate to the lead — it suggests insufficient decomposition or an architectural gap.

Produce a **Feature Implementation Brief** containing:
- Feature ID and name
- Development priority (P0/P1/P2/P3)
- Queue position (e.g., "Feature 7 of 23")
- List of user stories to implement (with acceptance criteria)
- List of screens/components to build or modify
- List of backend functions/endpoints to build or modify (e.g., Convex functions)
- List of schema changes needed (new tables, new indexes, field additions)
- Business rules to enforce
- Security considerations
- **Cross-feature integration notes**:
  - Already-completed features this feature depends on
  - Already-completed features that need updates to integrate with this feature
  - Data flows between this feature and existing features
- Test scenarios (derived from acceptance criteria)
- Cross-feature test scenarios (test the interaction between this feature and already-built features)

#### Cross-Feature Integration Levels (Step 1 continued)

When analyzing a feature's dependencies on existing features, classify each integration point:
- **Level 1 (Data-only)**: Feature A writes to a table that Feature B reads. No UI changes needed in B — just verify the data contract. *Example*: "Upload File" writes to Files table; "File Browser" reads from Files table — existing query already covers the new data.
- **Level 2 (UI reference)**: Feature A's output appears in Feature B's UI (e.g., a count, a list item, a status badge). Requires hook/component updates in B. *Example*: "Analytics Dashboard" computes a metric; "User Profile" should show this metric — requires importing the analytics hook and adding a display element.
- **Level 3 (Workflow)**: Completing Feature A enables or changes Feature B's behavior (e.g., creating a project unlocks the pipeline tab). Requires navigation/conditional rendering updates in B + related E2E test updates. *Example*: "Project Creation" adds a project; "Project Settings" only accessible if a project exists — requires conditional rendering in navigation.

For each integration point, note the level and affected files. Level 2+ integrations require explicit coordination between backend and frontend teammates.

**Cross-feature testing requirements by level**: (1) Level 1 — backend teammate writes a query test verifying data from the prior feature is readable via the new feature's queries. (2) Level 2 — backend teammate writes tests for any new hooks/mutations the prior feature's UI needs; frontend teammate verifies the prior feature's UI renders the new data. (3) Level 3 — E2E teammate writes a test verifying workflow state changes (conditional rendering, navigation, feature unlock). These tests MUST pass before marking the feature done.

Create the `./plancasting/_briefs/` directory if it does not exist, then save the brief to `./plancasting/_briefs/<feature-id>.md` for reference.
Format: Markdown with YAML frontmatter containing `featureId`, `featureName`, `priority`, `status`, and `dependencies`.

#### Step 2: Schema & Backend Implementation (Teammate: "backend")

Spawn a teammate with the Feature Implementation Brief and these instructions:

~~~
You are implementing the backend for feature [FEATURE_ID]: [FEATURE_NAME].
This is feature [N] of [TOTAL] in a full-product build. ALL features will be implemented.

Read CLAUDE.md first (created in Stages 3–4 — especially Part 2 'Project-Specific Configuration' and Part 1 rules). Then read the Feature Implementation Brief at ./plancasting/_briefs/<feature-id>.md.
Check `./plancasting/tech-stack.md` for the `Session Language` setting. Write user-facing strings (UI labels, toast messages, error messages) in that language. Code and comments remain in English.

Your tasks:
0. SCAFFOLD INVENTORY (MANDATORY — do this BEFORE writing any code):
   - List ALL existing scaffold files for this feature in your backend directory (e.g., `convex/<domain>.ts` and `convex/_internal/<domain>.ts`).
   - Read each file. Note which functions already have scaffold bodies vs. which are empty.
   - Your job is to implement business logic INSIDE these existing files. Do NOT create new files for functions that already have scaffold files. Do NOT rewrite function signatures that are already correct.
   - If the scaffold manifest exists at `./plancasting/_scaffold-manifest.md`, read the "Backend Functions" section for this feature to see exactly which files and function names were generated.
   - If `./plancasting/_scaffold-manifest.md` does not exist (manifest was not generated during Stage 3 — fallback to manual directory scanning), manually scan the backend directory (e.g., `ls convex/` or equivalent for your backend) to discover existing scaffold files before writing new ones.
   - Only create NEW files if a function is genuinely missing from the scaffold (not listed in the manifest).

1. SCHEMA CHANGES: If the brief requires new tables or indexes, update your schema file (e.g., `convex/schema.ts`).
   - Add new defineTable entries or modify existing ones.
   - Add indexes for all query patterns needed by this feature's screens.
   - Do NOT remove or rename existing tables/fields — this is additive only.
   - If adding fields to existing tables that are used by already-completed features, verify that existing functions still work with the schema change.
   - **Crash recovery**: If you are a re-spawned teammate resuming after a crash, first scan the schema file for any tables/fields you were assigned to add. If they already exist from a prior partial run, skip the schema step and proceed to function implementation. Do NOT re-create existing tables — this causes deployment errors.

2. BACKEND FUNCTIONS: Implement or update functions in your backend directory (e.g., `convex/<domain>.ts`).
   - For each API endpoint listed in the brief:
     a. Determine function type per CLAUDE.md rules (e.g., Convex: query/mutation/action; REST: GET/POST/PUT/DELETE).
     b. Implement full argument validation using your backend's validation library (e.g., Convex `v` validators, Zod, etc.).
     c. Implement authentication checks.
     d. Implement business rule validation.
     e. Implement the complete handler logic — no stubs, no TODOs.
     f. Add JSDoc with PRD/BRD traceability.
   - For internal helper logic, use your internal backend directory (e.g., `convex/_internal/<domain>.ts`).

3. CROSS-FEATURE INTEGRATION: If the brief lists integration notes:
   - Update existing backend functions in other domain files if they need to accommodate this feature.
   - Add cross-domain functions if this feature reads/writes data owned by another feature.
   - Verify existing functions that touch shared data still work correctly.

4. BACKEND TESTS: Write tests in your backend test directory (e.g., `convex/__tests__/<domain>.test.ts`).
   - One test case per acceptance criterion from the user stories.
   - Test argument validation, auth checks, happy path, error cases, edge cases, business rules.
   - Add cross-feature integration tests if this feature interacts with already-completed features.

   ### Backend Testing Rules (adapt to your framework — example below uses Convex)

   **General rules (a, d, g, m):**

   a. **Module map**: If a `[backend-dir]/__tests__/backend-modules.test-utils.ts` (e.g., `convex/__tests__/convex-modules.test-utils.ts`) file exists
      with an explicit module map, ALWAYS import `modules` from it and pass to
      `convexTest(schema, modules)`. NEVER call `convexTest(schema)` without the module
      map — `import.meta.glob` is unavailable in Vitest's node environment.

   d. **Skip vs test classification**: NOT all Convex functions are testable in
      `convex-test`. Actions that make external HTTP calls should be `it.skip()`
      with a comment explaining why. Test the *internal mutations/queries* they
      delegate to instead.

   g. **Return value verification**: Before writing assertions on a function's return
      shape, read the ACTUAL `returns` validator in the implementation. Don't assume
      the return shape from PRD descriptions alone.

   m. **Quota rollback on failure**: If an operation increments a usage counter (e.g.,
      `planCastsUsed`) BEFORE executing the actual work, it MUST decrement on failure.
      Otherwise, failed attempts consume quota and eventually block the user. Either:
      (a) increment AFTER success, or (b) wrap in try/catch and decrement in the catch.

   **Data rules (b, e):**

   b. **Soft-delete filter compatibility**: When inserting test data directly via
      `ctx.db.insert()`, ALWAYS include `deletedAt: null` for any table that uses
      soft-delete filters (`q.eq(q.field("deletedAt"), null)`). Omitting `deletedAt`
      gives the field value `undefined`, which does NOT match the `null` filter.

   e. **Schema-first test data**: ALWAYS read your schema file (e.g., `convex/schema.ts`) to get valid enum
      values, required fields, and index definitions before writing test data
      factories. Never invent plausible values.

   **Auth rules (c, f):**

   c. **Environment variables for actions**: Actions that call external APIs
      ([your auth provider], [your payment provider], [your external services]) check env vars at the top. Set required
      env vars in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`:
      ~~~typescript
      beforeAll(() => {
        process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL = "http://localhost:3000";
        process.env.YOUR_AUTH_PROVIDER_API_KEY = "sk_test_fake";
      });
      ~~~

   f. **Auth error expectations**: When testing non-member access to a resource that
      is looked up BEFORE the permission check, expect `NOT_FOUND` (not `FORBIDDEN`).
      This is correct security behavior — don't leak resource existence.

   **External API rules (h, i, j, k, l):**

   h. **OAuth redirect_uri consistency**: If implementing OAuth flows (GitHub, Vercel,
      Google, etc.), the `redirect_uri` MUST be identical in BOTH the authorization
      initiation code AND the callback handler code. Even a trailing `/callback` suffix
      mismatch will cause the provider to reject the request. Use the SAME variable or
      utility function to construct the redirect_uri in both places.

   i. **External API identifiers**: NEVER invent API model IDs, endpoint URLs, or
      version strings. Always reference the official API documentation. Common mistake:
      using an outdated or hallucinated model ID instead of the current one listed in
      the provider's documentation. Model IDs change with new releases — always verify
      against the provider's current API docs. Verify all external identifiers against
      the provider's docs before using them in code.

   j. **Error logging for external calls**: Every `fetch()` to an external API that
      handles a non-ok response MUST log the response status and body (via
      `console.error`) BEFORE returning a user-friendly fallback message. Silent error
      swallowing makes production debugging impossible.

   k. **Environment variable naming consistency**: Before reading `process.env.SOME_KEY`,
      grep the codebase for every other file that reads the same logical secret (e.g.,
      the Anthropic API key). ALL references MUST use the EXACT same variable name.
      Common failure: one file reads `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` while every other file reads
      `TRANSMUTER_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — the mismatch returns an empty string silently
      and the feature fails only in production. Cross-check against `.env.local.example`
      or `.env.production.example` for the canonical variable names.

   l. **Third-party service limits**: NEVER hardcode timeout, size, or rate values
      without verifying the provider's actual limits. Common failure: setting an E2B
      sandbox timeout to 2 hours when the free tier max is 1 hour → API returns 400.
      Always check the provider's documentation for tier-specific constraints, and add
      a comment citing the source (e.g., `// E2B free tier max: 1 hour`).

5. VERIFICATION: After implementation, run:
   - Start your backend dev server (e.g., `bunx convex dev`), verify it starts without schema errors or deployment failures, then stop it. Alternatively, run a dry-run deploy if available, or just run the backend test suite to verify function correctness.
   - [your test command] [your backend test path] (e.g., `bun run test -- convex/__tests__/<domain>.test.ts`) to verify NEW tests pass.
   - [your test command] [your backend test directory] (e.g., `bun run test -- convex/__tests__/`) to verify ALL existing backend tests still pass (no regressions).
   Fix any errors before marking your task as complete.

When done, message the lead with:
- **Files created/modified** (with full paths)
- **Exported symbols** (function names, types)
- **Schema/data changes** (new tables, indexes, field additions — if any)
- Any EXISTING files modified for cross-feature integration (critical for lead to track)
- **Assumptions made**
- **Test results** (new tests + regression check)
- **Integration notes for the next teammate** (what the frontend teammate needs to know: hook names, response shapes, error codes, any non-obvious data contracts)
~~~

#### Step 3: Frontend Implementation (Teammate: "frontend")

**Blocked by**: Step 2 completion.

Spawn a teammate with the Feature Implementation Brief AND the backend teammate's completion message:

~~~
You are implementing the frontend for feature [FEATURE_ID]: [FEATURE_NAME].
This is feature [N] of [TOTAL] in a full-product build. ALL features will be implemented.

CRITICAL: Before writing any code, read these in order:
1. CLAUDE.md (especially the "Design & Visual Identity" section)
2. Check `./plancasting/tech-stack.md` for the `Session Language` setting. Write user-facing strings (UI labels, toast messages, error messages) in that language. Code and comments remain in English.
3. tech-stack.md "Design Direction" section — for the selected UI component library, aesthetic direction, design reference URLs, and Figma designs. These are the authoritative design inputs from the user.
4. The existing design tokens at src/styles/design-tokens.ts
5. The Feature Implementation Brief at ./plancasting/_briefs/<feature-id>.md

DESIGN GUIDELINES (follow throughout all frontend work):
- Execute the aesthetic direction from tech-stack.md with precision. If the "Design Direction" section in tech-stack.md is missing or incomplete, fall back to: (a) existing component styles in completed features (copy the pattern), (b) design tokens in `src/styles/design-tokens.ts` if it exists, (c) the UI component library's default theme.
- Match the established design tokens.
- Build components using the UI component library specified in tech-stack.md (e.g., Untitled UI, shadcn/ui, Radix).
- Typography: Choose fonts intentionally — avoid defaulting to generic fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system-ui) unless they align with the project's stated design direction in `design-tokens.ts`. Use the fonts established in design-tokens.ts.
- Color: Use dominant colors with sharp accents — not evenly-distributed palettes. Follow the palette in design-tokens.ts.
- Motion: Apply purposeful animations — CSS transitions on hover/focus, staggered reveals on page load, smooth state changes.
- Spatial composition: Use intentional layout choices — asymmetry, generous negative space, controlled density.
- NEVER produce generic AI aesthetics: no default Tailwind colors, no cookie-cutter card grids, no purple-on-white gradients.

The backend teammate has completed their work. Here are the backend functions available: [PASTE BACKEND COMPLETION MESSAGE]. Copy the backend teammate's completion message verbatim — include function signatures, return types, error codes, and integration notes.

Your tasks:
0. SCAFFOLD INVENTORY (MANDATORY — do this BEFORE writing any code):
   - List ALL existing scaffold files for this feature:
     a. Components: `ls [your components directory] (e.g., src/components/features/<feature-name>/)`
     b. Hooks: `ls [your hooks directory] (e.g., src/hooks/use<FeatureName>*)`
     c. Pages: `ls [your pages directory] (e.g., src/app/(dashboard|...)/<feature-route>/)`
   - Read each file. Note which have scaffold bodies ("implementation pending") vs. which already have real code.
   - If the scaffold manifest exists at `./plancasting/_scaffold-manifest.md`, read the sections for this feature to see:
     - Which component files were generated and which PAGE imports them
     - Which hooks were generated and which components consume them
   - If the manifest does NOT exist (e.g., Stage 3 was run with an older prompt version), manually scan the directories: `ls src/components/features/`, `ls src/hooks/`, `ls src/app/` to discover existing scaffold files before writing new ones.
   - YOUR RULE: Implement business logic INSIDE the existing scaffold component files. Do NOT rebuild UI inline in page files when a scaffold component already exists for that purpose. The page's job is to COMPOSE components, not to contain all the UI logic.
   - Only create NEW component files if a UI element is genuinely missing from the scaffold (not listed in the manifest). If you create a new file, it MUST be imported by a page.
   - If a scaffold file exists but the page ALSO has inline UI for the same purpose (duplication from a previous run), DELETE the inline page UI and use the scaffold component instead.

1. CUSTOM HOOKS: Create or update hooks in [your hooks directory] (e.g., `src/hooks/`).
   - Wrap the backend functions for this feature.
   - Include loading, error, and optimistic update handling.
   - If this feature's data appears in already-completed features' UIs (e.g., a count badge, a summary widget), update those hooks to include the new data source.

2. COMPONENTS: Create or update components in [your components directory]/<feature-name>/ (e.g., `src/components/features/<feature-name>/`).
   - For each screen in the brief: implement with all states.
   - Implement all interactive behaviors from the screen spec.
   - Add ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.
   - Implement responsive behavior with INTENTIONAL layout changes per breakpoint (not just column stacking).
   - Use custom hooks.
   - DESIGN QUALITY (mandatory):
     a. Use ONLY the design tokens from `[styles-dir]/design-tokens.ts` (e.g., `src/styles/design-tokens.ts`) — never hardcode colors, fonts, or spacing.
     b. Apply micro-interactions: CSS transitions on hover/focus states, smooth state changes, subtle entrance animations.
     c. Skeleton screens for loading states must match the actual component layout and use the design system's colors.
     d. Empty states must be visually composed with illustrations or icons — not just text saying "No items found."
     e. Icons: ALWAYS use the project's icon library (specified in `plancasting/tech-stack.md` "Icon library" field). Import from the barrel file at `src/components/ui/icons.ts` or directly from the library package. NEVER use inline SVG `<path>` elements for standard UI icons (navigation arrows, action buttons, status indicators, empty states, etc.). The only acceptable inline SVGs are: product logos, brand marks, or custom illustrations that don't exist in any icon library.
     f. Error states must be styled and helpful — not raw error strings.
     g. NEVER produce generic AI-looking UI: no default Tailwind colors, no Inter/Roboto fonts, no uniform card grids, no purple-on-white gradients.
     h. Every component must be visually consistent with already-completed features. Check existing components for patterns.

3. CROSS-FEATURE UI UPDATES: If the brief lists integration notes:
   - Update existing components that need to display data from this feature.
   - Update navigation if new routes are added.
   - Update dashboard/summary components if they aggregate data that now includes this feature.
   - Ensure shared UI patterns (forms, modals, notifications) are consistent with existing features AND the design direction.

4. PAGES: Create or update pages in [your pages directory] (e.g., `src/app/` for Next.js App Router).
   - Wire components into the appropriate route.
   - Add loading states (e.g., `loading.tsx` for Next.js App Router, or inline loading components for other frameworks) with skeleton screens that match the page layout and design tokens.
   - Add error boundaries (e.g., `error.tsx` for Next.js App Router, or `<ErrorBoundary>` wrapper for other frameworks).
   - Use [ssr-data-loading-pattern] (e.g., `preloadQuery` for Convex + Next.js) where SEO matters.
   - Add metadata exports for SEO.
   - Apply page-level composition: background treatment, spacing rhythm, visual flow.

5. FEATURE FLAGS: If this feature has ops/experiment/permission flags:
   - Wrap appropriate components with <FeatureGate>.
   - Implement fallback UIs.
   - Remember: these are NOT release gates. The feature ships enabled. Flags are for kill switches, A/B tests, or role gating.

6. COMPONENT TESTS: Write tests in [your test directory]/<feature-name>/ (e.g., `src/__tests__/components/<feature-name>/`).
   - Test all component states.
   - Test user interactions.
   - Include accessibility checks.
   - Test cross-feature UI integrations if applicable.

   ### Frontend Testing Pitfalls (jsdom + testing-library — React-specific; adapt patterns to Vue/Svelte equivalents if applicable)

   a. **Portal components**: Components using `createPortal` (Dialog, Sheet, Modal,
      ConfirmDialog) render into `document.body`, invisible to testing-library. Mock
      `react-dom` in the test file:
      ~~~typescript
      vi.mock("react-dom", async () => {
        const actual = await vi.importActual<typeof import("react-dom")>("react-dom");
        return { ...actual, createPortal: (node: React.ReactNode) => node };
      });
      ~~~

   b. **SVG className**: In jsdom, `svgElement.className` returns `SVGAnimatedString`,
      not a string. Use `svgElement.getAttribute("class")` instead.

   c. **axe + canvas**: axe-core's color contrast check calls `canvas.getContext()`,
      which jsdom doesn't implement. Stub it in test setup:
      ~~~typescript
      HTMLCanvasElement.prototype.getContext = vi.fn();
      ~~~

   d. **Multiple role="status"**: Components that wrap other `role="status"` elements
      (e.g., LoadingState wrapping Spinner) produce multiple matches. Use
      `getAllByRole("status")` with `.find()` instead of `getByRole("status")`.

   e. **`exactOptionalPropertyTypes`**: Don't pass `prop={undefined}` to components —
      TypeScript's exactOptionalPropertyTypes treats this differently from omitting
      the prop entirely.

   f. **Button visibility vs. enablement mismatch**: When a button's render condition
      and its `disabled`/`isDisabled` condition are defined separately, they can
      disagree. Example: a button renders when `(!status || status === "cancelled")`
      but `canStart` only checks `!status` — so the button shows but is always
      disabled for cancelled runs. Rule: every state that satisfies the RENDER
      condition must also be reachable by the ENABLE condition. Test all terminal
      states (cancelled, failed, completed) to verify the button is both visible
      AND clickable when it should be.

7. STUB ELIMINATION (CRITICAL — non-negotiable):
   Your job is to REPLACE scaffold stubs with functional implementations. Before declaring completion:
   a. Grep every file you created/modified for: `implementation pending`, `pending feature build`, `⚠️ STUB`, `TODO [Stage 5]`, `Coming soon`, `Not yet implemented`, `PLACEHOLDER`.
      If ANY matches remain, you are NOT done. Replace them with real implementations.
   b. Every component must import and use hooks or receive real data via props — not `useState("")` with no data source.
   c. Every component must render meaningful interactive UI — not a single `<p>` tag with a description.
   d. Every component file you create MUST be imported by at least one page. If you create `src/components/features/foo/Bar.tsx`, verify that a page imports and renders `<Bar />`. Orphan files are forbidden.
   e. If a scaffold component file exists AND the page implements that same UI inline (duplication), ALWAYS preserve the scaffold component FILE (its path and exports). If the page's inline version has better code, move that code INTO the scaffold component file. Then refactor the page to import the scaffold component. The goal is: the scaffold file path is the canonical location; the best available code lives there.

8. I18N: Check `plancasting/tech-stack.md` for i18n configuration. If i18n is enabled: use translation keys (`t('key')`) for all user-facing strings — never hardcode display text directly. Add all new keys to the messages file(s). If i18n is NOT enabled: use hardcoded strings but follow naming and formatting conventions from the design tokens.

9. VERIFICATION: After implementation, run:
   (Replace `bun run` with your project's package manager from CLAUDE.md throughout this list.)
   - `bun run typecheck` — no type errors in the ENTIRE project.
   - `bun run lint` — no lint errors.
   - `bun run test -- [your test directory]/<feature-name>/` (e.g., `src/__tests__/components/<feature-name>/`) — new tests pass.
   - `bun run test -- [your test directory]/` (e.g., `src/__tests__/components/`) — ALL existing component tests still pass.
   - Stub scan: `grep -rn --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" --include="*.jsx" --include="*.js" "implementation pending\|pending feature build\|⚠️ STUB\|TODO \[Stage 5\]\|Coming soon\|Not yet implemented\|PLACEHOLDER" [your components directory]/<feature-name>/ | grep -v 'placeholder="\|Placeholder='` (e.g., `src/components/features/<feature-name>/`) — MUST return zero results.
   Fix any errors before marking your task as complete.

When done, message the lead with:
- **Files created/modified** (with full paths)
- **Exported symbols** (components, hooks, types)
- **Schema/data changes** (if any — e.g., new i18n keys added)
- List of pages/routes added
- List of EXISTING components/hooks modified for cross-feature integration
- List of ORPHAN component files deleted (scaffold stubs replaced by inline page implementations)
- Design consistency notes (any deviations from design tokens or new patterns introduced)
- **Assumptions made**
- **Test results** (new tests + regression check)
- **Integration notes for the next teammate** (what the E2E tester needs to know: new routes, test IDs, user flows implemented, any conditional UI that requires specific data states)
~~~

#### Step 4: E2E Tests (Teammate: "e2e-tester")

**Blocked by**: Step 3 completion.

Spawn a teammate:

~~~
You are writing E2E tests for feature [FEATURE_ID]: [FEATURE_NAME].
This is feature [N] of [TOTAL] in a full-product build.

Read CLAUDE.md first (created in Stages 3–4 — especially Part 2 'Project-Specific Configuration' and Part 1 rules). Then read the Feature Implementation Brief at ./plancasting/_briefs/<feature-id>.md.
Check `./plancasting/tech-stack.md` for the `Session Language` setting. Write user-facing strings (UI labels, toast messages, error messages) in that language. Code and comments remain in English.
Read the user flows in ./plancasting/prd/06-user-flows.md that involve this feature.

Your tasks:
0. SCAFFOLD INVENTORY: Check `e2e/` for existing scaffold test files for this feature. If scaffold E2E files exist (from Stage 3 Teammate 5), implement inside them rather than creating new files. Run `ls e2e/` to identify existing files.

1. FEATURE E2E TESTS: Write Playwright tests in `e2e/<feature-name>.spec.ts`.
   - One test file per user flow that touches this feature, with test cases covering happy path, critical alternative paths, and critical error paths.
   - Test responsive behavior on at least 2 viewports (mobile + desktop).

2. CROSS-FEATURE E2E TESTS: Write or update tests in `e2e/integration/`. Create `e2e/integration/` if it does not exist.
   - If this feature interacts with already-completed features, test the integrated journey.
   - Example: if this is a "billing" feature and "projects" is already built, test the flow: create project → use feature → see billing impact.
   - These cross-feature tests are critical for the full-build approach.

3. REGRESSION CHECK: Run ALL existing E2E tests to verify no regressions:
   - PREREQUISITE: E2E tests require a running dev server. First check if one is already running (`lsof -ti:<port>` where port is from CLAUDE.md). If not, start it (`bun run dev &` or equivalent per CLAUDE.md). Wait for the dev server to be ready (check for 'ready' or 'started' message). After ALL tests complete, stop the dev server (`lsof -ti:<port> | xargs kill 2>/dev/null`).
   - `bun run test:e2e` (adapt to your package manager per CLAUDE.md)
   - If existing tests fail, categorize each failure:
     a. Intentional behavior change due to new feature → update the test
     b. Bug introduced by new feature → report to lead

4. VERIFICATION: Run `bun run test:e2e -- e2e/<feature-name>.spec.ts` (adapt to your package manager per CLAUDE.md) to verify new tests pass.

5. **Test data cleanup**: Ensure tests clean up any data they create (users, projects, etc.). Use `test.afterEach` or `test.afterAll` hooks for cleanup. If tests require specific data state, document the setup requirements.

When done, message the lead with:
- **Files created/modified** (with full paths)
- **Exported symbols** (test suite names, helper functions)
- **Schema/data changes** (if any — e.g., test fixtures added)
- Number of test scenarios covered (feature-specific + cross-feature)
- Pass/fail summary for new tests
- Regression test results (pass/fail for ALL existing E2E tests)
- **Assumptions made** (e.g., test data prerequisites, environment requirements)
- **Test results** (detailed pass/fail counts)
- **Integration notes for the next teammate** (any bugs discovered, PRD gaps found, flaky test patterns to be aware of)
~~~

#### Step 5: Quality Gate (Lead only)

After all 3 teammates complete their tasks for this feature:

> Items 1-6 are **blocking** (fail = feature not done). Items 8 and 10 are **required for session recovery** — always complete them even if other items are deferred. Items 11-12 (teammate shutdown and feature progression) are **always required**. Items 7 and 9 are **secondary** (fail = documented for Stage 5B).

1. **Collect results** from all teammates.
2. **Verify full integration**:
   - Run `bun run typecheck` (full project).
   - Run `bun run test` (all unit + integration tests across ALL features).
   - Run `bun run test:e2e` (all E2E tests across ALL features — not just this one).
3. **Fix regressions**: If existing tests break, diagnose and fix. Spawn a fix teammate if needed.
4. **Cross-feature verification**: If this feature modified files belonging to other features:
   - Verify those features still work correctly.
   - Run their specific E2E tests.
5. **Module map sync check** (if applicable to your backend framework): If the backend teammate created new backend function files,
      verify they are registered in your test module map (e.g., `[backend-dir]/__tests__/backend-modules.test-utils.ts`, such as `convex/__tests__/convex-modules.test-utils.ts` for Convex).
      If entries are missing, add them yourself — this is a one-line-per-file mechanical change: import the module and add it to the map object.
      Missing entries cause ALL tests that reference those modules to fail.
6. **Traceability check**: Verify that all user stories for this feature have:
   - At least one backend function/endpoint implementing them
   - At least one component rendering them
   - At least one test validating their acceptance criteria
7. **Design consistency check**: Verify that new components:
   - Use design tokens from the project's design-tokens file (see CLAUDE.md or tech-stack.md for path; e.g., `src/styles/design-tokens.ts`) — no hardcoded colors/fonts/spacing
   - Follow the established aesthetic direction (no generic AI-looking elements)
   - Are visually consistent with previously completed features
8. **Scaffold manifest update**: If any NEW files were created (not in the scaffold manifest), update `plancasting/_scaffold-manifest.md` to include them with their component-to-page mappings.
9. **Stub scan**: Run the Automated Stub Scan (see Anti-Stub Quality Gates section) on all files created/modified for this feature. If any stubs are found, send back to the responsible teammate for completion.
10. **Update progress**: Update `./plancasting/_progress.md`:
   - Mark this feature as ✅ Done
   - Record any cross-feature modifications made
   - Record any assumptions or deviations
   - Record any PRD gaps discovered
   - Update completion count: "X of Y features complete"
11. **Shutdown teammates** for this feature cycle.
12. **Proceed to next feature** in the queue — do NOT stop at any priority boundary. Continue through P0 → P1 → P2 → P3 until ALL features are done.

---

### Handling Failures

**Build errors**: If [your backend dev command] (e.g., `bunx convex dev`) or `bun run typecheck` fails:
- Send the error to the responsible teammate for fixing.
- If unresolvable, spawn a "debugger" teammate.

**Test failures (regression)**: If a previously passing test fails:
- Do NOT skip or delete the test.
- Diagnose: intentional change (update test) or bug (fix implementation).
- Document the resolution.

**Dependency conflicts**: If feature B depends on feature A but A has issues:
- Mark B as ⏸ Blocked in `plancasting/_progress.md` with the blocking feature noted in the 'Notes' column.
- Continue with the next non-blocked feature.
- **After each feature completes**: Scan `plancasting/_progress.md` for any features marked as ⏸ Blocked. For each, check if its dependency (noted in 'Notes') is now ✅ Done. If yes, change status to 🔧 In Progress and add to the queue. Perform this scan before moving to the next feature.

**Schema conflicts**: The lead resolves schema conflicts before spawning backend teammates.

**Cross-feature breaks**: If implementing feature N breaks feature M:
- This is the highest priority fix — address immediately.
- Spawn a "fix" teammate focused on resolving the cross-feature conflict.
- Do not proceed to feature N+1 until resolved.

### Full-Product Completion Sequence

After ALL features in the queue are implemented (every feature is ✅ Done in `plancasting/_progress.md`):

#### 1. Full Integration Test Suite

~~~bash
# Use your test commands from CLAUDE.md. Example:
bun run typecheck
bun run lint
bun run test
bun run test:e2e
~~~

All must pass. Fix any failures.

#### 2. Cross-Feature Integration Sweep

Spawn a "cross-feature-auditor" teammate:

~~~
You are auditing the COMPLETE product for cross-feature integration issues.

Read CLAUDE.md first.
Check `./plancasting/tech-stack.md` for the `Session Language` setting. Write all findings and annotations in the Session Language.
Read ./plancasting/prd/06-user-flows.md — especially flows that span multiple features.
Read ./plancasting/prd/02-feature-map-and-prioritization.md cross-feature interaction matrix.

Your tasks:
1. For each cross-feature user flow in the PRD, verify that:
   - An E2E test exists covering the full flow
   - The data flows correctly between features
   - Shared UI elements (navigation, dashboard, notifications) correctly aggregate data from ALL features

2. Identify any untested cross-feature interactions:
   - Dashboard aggregations spanning all feature areas
   - Notification triggers from all features
   - Search/filter across all data types
   - Permission checks across all features
   - Analytics tracking across all features

3. Write additional E2E tests in `e2e/integration/full-product/` for any gaps found.

4. Run the complete E2E suite and report results.

5. Priority order for fixes and escalations:
   (1) Flag but do NOT fix data model inconsistencies — these require schema changes and a Stage 5 backend re-run.
   (2) Flag navigation gaps but do not add links (page structure is final).
   (3) Fix simple integration issues (e.g., missing data flow between two working features).
   List any issues requiring Stage 5 re-run as 'Integration Blockers' in the audit report.
~~~

#### 3. Onboarding Flow Verification

Spawn an "onboarding-auditor" teammate if the PRD includes onboarding flows (check `prd/06-user-flows.md` for onboarding/first-time flows, or `prd/08-screen-specifications.md` for onboarding screens). Skip this teammate if neither file references onboarding, getting started, first-time user experience, or welcome flow:

~~~
You are verifying the onboarding experience for the COMPLETE product.

Read CLAUDE.md first.
Check `./plancasting/tech-stack.md` for the `Session Language` setting. Write all findings and annotations in the Session Language.
Since all features are available from day one, the onboarding flow must guide users through the full product without overwhelming them.

Your tasks:
1. Verify that progressive disclosure / guided tour components exist and work.
2. Test the first-time user experience end-to-end.
3. Verify empty states across ALL features guide users to take action.
4. Write E2E tests for the complete onboarding flow in `e2e/onboarding.spec.ts`.
~~~

#### 4. Performance Validation

This is a lightweight sanity check — not a substitute for Stage 6C. Do NOT implement optimizations here; only flag critical blockers (e.g., page fails to load within 10s, bundle exceeds budget by 2x+). All optimization work happens in Stage 6C. (These thresholds are defaults — override with values from PRD `15-non-functional-specifications.md` if available.)

Spawn a "performance-auditor" teammate:

~~~
You are validating performance for the COMPLETE product with ALL features active.

Read CLAUDE.md first.
Check `./plancasting/tech-stack.md` for the `Session Language` setting. Write all findings and annotations in the Session Language.
Read ./plancasting/prd/15-non-functional-specifications.md for performance budgets.

Your tasks:
1. Verify bundle size is within budget (all features contribute to the bundle).
2. Run Lighthouse CI and verify scores meet targets.
3. Identify any performance bottlenecks from having all features active simultaneously.
4. Check that backend queries with indexes/optimizations perform adequately under the full schema.
5. Report findings using these explicit thresholds:
   - **Critical blockers requiring immediate fix before Stage 6**: (1) any page load >10s on 4G throttle, (2) bundle >100% over stated budget. Flag to lead immediately.
   - **Minor issues** (5–10s load, 50–100% over budget) → log in audit report for Stage 6C.
   - Do NOT implement optimization fixes in this stage — Stage 6C handles all optimization.
~~~

**Post-Audit Gate**: After all auditor teammates complete, review their findings. If any auditor reports critical issues (broken cross-feature flows, failing E2E tests, or performance budgets exceeded by >50%), fix the issues before proceeding to the Final Implementation Report — spawn targeted fix teammates if needed. Critical blockers (>10s load, >100% over budget) should be investigated for root cause (e.g., missing code splitting, accidentally bundled large dependency). Fix the root cause if it's a clear implementation bug. Do NOT perform general optimization — that's Stage 6C. If only minor issues are found, document them in the report's Known Issues section.

#### 5. Final Implementation Report

Generate `./plancasting/_implementation-report.md` containing:
- **Completion Summary**:
  - Total features implemented: X of X (should be 100%)
  - Total files created/modified
  - Total backend functions/endpoints (e.g., queries, mutations, actions, internal functions)
  - Total components
  - Total custom hooks
  - Total test cases: unit, component, E2E
- **PRD Coverage**:
  - User stories covered vs total (target: 100%)
  - Screen specs covered vs total (target: 100%)
  - API specs covered vs total (target: 100%)
  - User flows with E2E tests vs total
- **Cross-Feature Integration**:
  - Number of cross-feature interactions documented
  - Number of cross-feature E2E tests
  - Any integration issues found and resolved
- **Quality Metrics**:
  - TypeScript errors: 0
  - Lint errors: 0
  - Test pass rate: unit, component, E2E
  - Bundle size vs budget
  - Lighthouse scores vs targets

#### 6. Shutdown
Shut down all remaining teammates and clean up team resources.

## Session Recovery

If this session was started to RESUME a previously interrupted Plan Cast, resume using **positional scan** (top-to-bottom, not status-priority) — see the Session Recovery section above for the full procedure.

### Feature Blocking & Escalation

If a feature cannot proceed due to missing dependencies or external blockers:
1. Mark the feature as `⏸ Blocked` in `plancasting/_progress.md`
2. Add the blocker description in the Notes column (e.g., "Blocked: payment API key missing")
3. Continue to the next feature in the queue
4. At session end, summarize all blockers in the implementation report

## Critical Rules for the Lead

1. NEVER skip a feature. Every feature in the PRD must be implemented. There is no "good enough" stopping point.
2. NEVER skip the Feature Analysis step. Every feature must have a brief.
3. NEVER spawn the frontend teammate until the backend teammate confirms completion.
4. NEVER spawn the E2E teammate until the frontend teammate confirms completion.
5. NEVER proceed to the next feature until the quality gate passes (including regression tests).
6. NEVER proceed past a cross-feature break. Fix it immediately.
7. ALWAYS read CLAUDE.md at startup and ensure every teammate reads it. NEVER modify Part 1 (Immutable Framework Rules) of CLAUDE.md. If project-specific rules need updating, modify Part 2 only.
8. ALWAYS update `plancasting/_progress.md` after each feature cycle.
9. ALWAYS run the FULL test suite (not just the current feature's tests) at each quality gate.
10. If a feature requires creating or substantially modifying more than ~15 files total, split into sub-features and implement sequentially. See the Feature Splitting rule above (§ Full-Build Approach) for the canonical definition including timing, sub-feature tracking, and splitting strategy. **Quick reference**: (1) Identify logical sub-features from user stories. (2) Each sub-feature should be independently testable. (3) Update `_progress.md` with IDs like `FEAT-003a`, `FEAT-003b`. (4) Parent feature is marked Done only when all sub-features are Done.
11. After ALL features are complete, ALWAYS run the Full-Product Completion Sequence (cross-feature audit, onboarding audit, performance audit) before generating the final report. The Full-Product Completion Sequence MUST run at least once, even if interrupted previously. If `plancasting/_implementation-report.md` exists but lacks a "Launch Readiness Assessment" section, re-run the Full-Product Completion Sequence.
12. The final report must show 100% PRD coverage. If it doesn't, identify gaps and implement them before declaring completion.

## Anti-Stub Quality Gates (CRITICAL)

The scaffold phase (Stage 3) creates files with placeholder bodies like `"implementation pending feature build"`. Stage 5's job is to REPLACE these with functional implementations. A feature is NOT done if any of its components still contain scaffold-quality code.

### Stub Detection Rules

Before marking ANY feature as ✅ Done, the lead MUST verify the following for every file created or modified:

1. **No placeholder text patterns**: Grep all files touched by this feature for these patterns. If ANY match, the feature is NOT done:
   - `implementation pending`
   - `pending feature build`
   - `// ⚠️ STUB`
   - `// TODO [Stage 5]`
   - `Coming soon` (only acceptable as a user-facing UI label in components that the PRD explicitly defines as showing a "coming soon" state. It is NOT acceptable as a placeholder for unimplemented functionality)
   - `Not yet implemented`
   - `PLACEHOLDER` (excluding HTML placeholder attributes like `placeholder="Enter name"`)
   - Components that return only a single trivial element (e.g., a heading or paragraph with just a name/description string) with no interactive elements or real UI structure

2. **Functional component bodies**: Every component must:
   - Import and use at least one custom hook OR receive data via props from a parent that uses hooks
   - Render meaningful UI beyond a single paragraph of text
   - Handle loading, error, and empty states (per CLAUDE.md rules)
   - Have interactive elements (buttons, forms, links) that are wired to actual handlers

3. **No orphan components**: Every component file created must be imported by at least one page or parent component. If a component file exists but is not imported anywhere, it is dead code — either wire it in or delete it.

4. **Page-level data flow**: Every page must:
   - Use real data from hooks (not `useState("")` with no data source)
   - Have functional form submissions that call backend mutations/actions
   - Navigate to real routes (not `#` placeholders)

### Automated Stub Scan

At each quality gate (Step 5), run this scan BEFORE marking the feature as done:

~~~bash
# NOTE: `⚠️ STUB` markers are EXPECTED in scaffold code from Stage 3. Your job is to REPLACE
# every `⚠️ STUB:` marker with a functional implementation. After completing a feature, this
# scan across that feature's files MUST return zero results — all stubs must be resolved.

# Scan for stub patterns in modified files
grep -rn --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" --include="*.jsx" --include="*.js" "implementation pending\|pending feature build\|⚠️ STUB\|TODO \[Stage 5\]\|Coming soon\|Not yet implemented\|PLACEHOLDER" <modified-files> | grep -v 'placeholder="\|Placeholder='

# Scan for orphan components (created but never imported)
for file in <new-component-files>; do
  component_name=$(basename "$file" .tsx)
  # Replace [frontend-dir] with your actual frontend directory from CLAUDE.md (e.g., src/)
  if ! grep -rl "from.*${component_name}\|import.*${component_name}" [frontend-dir] --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" | grep -v "$file"; then
    echo "ORPHAN: $file is never imported"
  fi
done
~~~

If either scan finds issues, the feature MUST be sent back to the frontend teammate for completion. Do NOT mark it as ✅ Done.

### Pre-existing vs. New Errors

If typecheck/lint errors are introduced by THIS feature's new code, fix them before marking the feature done. If errors are PRE-EXISTING (introduced by another feature or prior stage), document in the feature brief notes and proceed — the lead will diagnose at Step 5 (Quality Gate) or escalate to the next stage.

### Quality Gate Failure Escalation

If a teammate produces scaffold-quality output (stub components, placeholder text, unconnected hooks):
1. Do NOT accept the work. Send it back with specific instructions on what needs to be functional.
2. If the teammate cannot produce functional code (e.g., missing backend dependency), mark the feature as `⏸ Blocked` with the blocker description in the Notes column.
3. NEVER mark a feature as ✅ Done to "move on" — this creates false progress that compounds into a broken product.

## Note on Stage 5B (Implementation Completeness Audit)

After this stage completes, Stage 5B will run a FRESH full-codebase audit specifically looking for two failure patterns:

1. **Stub pattern**: Frontend components remain as scaffolds with placeholder text — caused by quality gate relaxation in long implementation sessions (sessions beyond the tech-stack.md § Model Specifications "Session feature limit" show measurable quality decline). ~80% of issues.
2. **Duplication pattern**: Frontend teammate builds UI inline in page files instead of implementing inside existing scaffold component files — creating orphan components that are never imported. This is caused by the teammate not inventorying scaffold files before writing code.

This audit is NOT a reason to relax quality gates — it is a safety net. The mandatory SCAFFOLD INVENTORY step (Step 0 in frontend/backend teammate instructions) is the PRIMARY defense against both patterns. If you detect your context window is becoming saturated (late in a long feature queue), end the session and resume fresh rather than degrading quality. If a session must end before all features complete, prioritize BACKEND completeness — backend stubs are harder to fix in 5B. Frontend stubs are addressed by Stage 5B's dedicated frontend-stub-fixer — but this is a last-resort triage, not a reason to deprioritize frontend completeness during Stage 5.
