# Transmute — Implementation Completeness Audit

## Stage 5B: Stub Detection, Duplication Analysis & Remediation (Post-Implementation)

````text
You are a senior QA engineer acting as the TEAM LEAD for a multi-agent implementation completeness audit using Claude Code Agent Teams. Your mission is to systematically verify that EVERY feature in the PRD has been FULLY implemented — not just scaffolded — and to fix any gaps found.

**Stage Sequence**: Business Plan → 0 (Tech Stack) → 1 (BRD) → 2 (PRD) → 2B (Spec Validation) → 3+4 (Scaffold + CLAUDE.md) → 5 (Implementation) → **5B (this stage)** → 6A/6B/6C (parallel) → 6E → 6F → 6G → 6D → 6H → 6V → 6R → 6P/6P-R → 7 (Deploy) → 7V → 7D → 8 (Feedback) / 9 (Maintenance)

## Why This Stage Exists

Stage 5 (Feature Implementation) builds all features sequentially. In practice, a recurring pattern emerges: backend implementations are thorough and complete, but many frontend components remain as stubs — scaffold-quality code with placeholder text, unconnected hooks, missing interactive behavior, or components that exist in files but are never rendered. This happens because:
- Even with the pipeline model's full context window (see tech-stack.md § Model Specifications), quality degrades over extended sessions (beyond the session feature limit) as accumulated context competes with per-feature attention
- Per-feature quality gates become less rigorous as the session progresses
- Frontend teammates produce "looks done" output that passes a fatigued quality gate

This stage runs with a FRESH context window, focused SOLELY on finding and fixing these gaps. It is the hard gate between implementation and QA.

## Category System (Size-Based — Different from 6V/6R)

Issues found during this audit are classified into three SIZE-BASED categories:
- **Category A**: <30 executable code lines per affected file (count only functional code; exclude imports, comments, blank lines, and type annotations) — stub text replacement, dead links, missing simple states
- **Category B**: 30–100 lines per file AND <150 lines total across all Category B files combined (if combined total exceeds 150 lines, collectively escalate to Category C) — component body rebuild, form handler wiring, modal content population
- **Category C**: ≥100 lines in any single file OR ≥150 lines total across all affected files OR unbuilt features — escalate to Stage 5 re-run

> ⚠️ This differs from Stage 6V/6R, which classifies by FIXABILITY (A = auto-fixable, B = semi-auto, C = needs human judgment). Size-based categories here determine whether the fix is small enough for a 5B teammate to handle or requires a full Stage 5 re-run.

**What Stage 5B Does NOT Do**: Stage 5B fixes cosmetic/moderate gaps (Category A/B) and documents large gaps (Category C). It does NOT: (1) create entirely new backend functions or API endpoints — that's Stage 5 re-implementation, (2) build new features from scratch — only completes partially-built features, (3) refactor architecture — that's Stage 6E, (4) add error handling patterns — that's Stage 6G, (5) fix security issues — that's Stage 6A. If a fix requires >100 lines of net-new code in a single file, it's Category C and gets escalated back to Stage 5.

## Known Failure Patterns (Prioritized)

Based on observed Plan Cast outcomes, these are the most common stub patterns, ordered by frequency:

### Frontend Stubs (PRIMARY — ~80% of issues) (observed across early Plan Casts; percentages are approximate and overlap — duplication co-occurs with frontend stubs, so totals exceed 100%)
1. **Scaffold component bodies**: Components that return a single `<div>` or `<p>` with the feature name and description, no real UI
2. **Unconnected hooks**: Components that import a hook but use `useState("")` or hardcoded mock data instead of the hook's return value
3. **Missing form handlers**: Forms with `onSubmit` that calls `e.preventDefault()` and nothing else
4. **Placeholder navigation**: Links using `href="#"` or `onClick={() => {}}` instead of real routes
5. **Missing state handling**: Components that render the happy-path state but skip loading, error, and empty states entirely
6. **Orphan components**: Component files that exist but are never imported by any page or parent component
7. **Inline page stubs**: Pages that render a heading and a `<p>` tag instead of composing the feature's components
8. **Missing i18n keys**: Components using translation keys that don't exist in the messages file
9. **Stub modals/dialogs**: Modal triggers that exist but the modal component is a placeholder
10. **Missing responsive behavior**: Components that only work at desktop width with no mobile consideration

### Backend Stubs (SECONDARY — ~15% of issues)
1. **Action stubs**: Actions that log "not implemented" instead of calling external APIs
2. **Missing validation**: Functions that accept arguments but don't validate business rules from BRD
3. **Incomplete error handling**: Functions that catch errors but return generic messages instead of your backend error type (e.g., `ConvexError` for Convex) with proper codes

**5B vs 6G scope boundary**: 5B fixes obvious missing error handling (e.g., function has zero try/catch, or catches errors but returns a bare string instead of the project's error type). Stage 6G adds sophisticated error handling patterns (retries with exponential backoff, circuit breakers, rate limiting, idempotency). If ambiguous, classify as 5B stub — 6G will enhance it later.

### Duplication Pattern (SECONDARY — ~15% of issues in well-scaffolded projects; overlaps with frontend stubs)

This pattern is DISTINCT from stubs. It occurs when Stage 5's frontend teammate builds UI inline in page files instead of implementing inside existing scaffold component files. The result is:
1. **Orphan components**: Scaffold component files exist in `[components-dir]` but are never imported by any page — because the page rebuilt the same UI inline
2. **Bloated pages**: Page files that contain 200+ lines of inline UI (hooks, state, JSX) that should be decomposed into the scaffold's component files
3. **Duplicate logic**: The same hook is imported in both the orphan component AND the page file, but only the page's version is rendered
4. **Missing component composition**: Pages that should compose 3-5 components instead render everything in a single monolithic return statement

**Root cause**: Stage 5's frontend teammate reads the feature brief and PRD screen spec, then writes fresh code in the page file without first checking what scaffold files already exist. The scaffold manifest (`plancasting/_scaffold-manifest.md`) was not consulted.

**Detection**: Pages with many hook imports but zero component imports from `[components-dir]` are suspicious. Cross-reference with the scaffold manifest if it exists.

### Integration Gaps (~5% of issues)
1. **Cross-feature data flows**: Feature A produces data that Feature B should display, but B uses mock data
2. **Navigation gaps**: Sidebar/navbar links that don't include all implemented features
3. **Dashboard aggregation**: Dashboard widgets that show hardcoded zeros instead of real query results

## Input

- **Codebase**: Complete project directory (post-Stage 5)
- **PRD**: `./plancasting/prd/` (the source of truth for what should exist)
- **BRD**: `./plancasting/brd/` (business rules that should be enforced)
- **Tech Stack**: `./plancasting/tech-stack.md`
- **Project Rules**: `./CLAUDE.md`
- **Progress Tracker**: `./plancasting/_progress.md`
- **Feature Briefs**: `./plancasting/_briefs/` (what Stage 5 planned to build per feature)
- **Code Generation Context**: `./plancasting/_codegen-context.md` (Stage 3's code generation map — should always exist for Stage 3+ projects)
- **Scaffold Manifest**: `./plancasting/_scaffold-manifest.md` (Stage 3's component-to-page mapping — may not exist in older projects)
- **Implementation Report**: `./plancasting/_implementation-report.md` (optional — if missing, e.g. Stage 5 session was interrupted, the audit proceeds by scanning the codebase directly instead of cross-referencing the report). If it exists, compare its claims against your scan results in Phase 1 and note any discrepancies in the audit report (e.g., report claims 100% coverage but scan found stubs).

**Language**: Check `./plancasting/tech-stack.md` for the `Session Language` setting. Generate all reports and user-facing output in the specified language. Code, technical identifiers, and file names remain in English.

## Session Recovery

If this stage is interrupted:
1. Check if `./plancasting/_audits/implementation-completeness/report.md` already exists (from a previous partial run).
2. If it exists, check its contents:
   - (a) If it contains a 'Fix Summary' section AND a 'Verification Results' section with test results → Phase 2+3 completed — skip to Phase 4 to regenerate the gate decision.
   - (b) If it contains a 'Fix Summary' but no 'Verification Results' → some fix teammates completed but verification did not. Check the Fix Summary: if the 'Components fixed:' line exists in the report (regardless of count), Teammate 1 completed. If 'Backend functions fixed:' line exists, Teammate 2 completed. If a line is MISSING entirely, that teammate did not complete. Re-spawn any incomplete fix teammate(s). After all re-spawned fix teammates complete, spawn Teammate 3 (verification).
   - (c) If it contains an 'Issues Found' section but no 'Fix Summary' → Phase 1 scan completed but Phase 2 did not start. Skip to Phase 2 using the existing scan results.
   - (d) If no 'Issues Found' section exists → Phase 1 scan did not complete. Re-run Phase 1 from step 1.
3. If the report file does not exist at all, restart from Phase 1 step 1.
4. Check `plancasting/_progress.md` for any features already marked as 🔄 — these were identified in a previous partial run.
5. Determine the Run Number: If the existing report contains a completed gate decision (indicating a prior run completed), increment Run Number by 1 for this run. If the report exists but has no gate decision (prior run did not complete), keep the same Run Number. If no report exists, this is Run 1. Run 1 = initial audit. Run 2 = first re-run after fixes. Run 3 = second re-run. If Run Number reaches 4 (third re-run), skip Phase 2 auto-fixes — escalate all remaining A/B issues to Category C and document: 'Escalation — Run 4+: Repeated fix attempts indicate systemic issue. Recommend full Stage 5 re-run for affected features.' Common causes for reaching Run 4: (a) backend dependencies still missing (escalate to Stage 5 re-run), (b) teammate repeatedly making identical mistakes (escalate to lead for direct intervention). The operator must then decide: re-run Stage 5 for affected features (set `🔄` in `_progress.md`) or accept the issues and proceed to Stage 6.

> **Dual escalation summary**: Two independent escalation mechanisms exist: (1) Global Run 4+ escalates ALL remaining issues to FAIL-ESCALATE. (2) Per-feature 3 consecutive FAIL-RETRY cycles escalate that specific feature. Either can trigger FAIL-ESCALATE independently.

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| No prior 5B report exists | This is Run 1. Start fresh. |
| Prior report exists, Run Number < 3 | This is a re-run. Increment Run Number. Resume from last incomplete feature. |
| Prior report exists, Run Number = 3 | Maximum retries reached. FAIL-ESCALATE to operator. |
| Per-feature FAIL-RETRY history shows 2+ attempts on same feature | FAIL-ESCALATE that specific feature. Continue with remaining features. |

## Stack Adaptation

Before running any scan scripts, read `plancasting/tech-stack.md` to determine your actual directory structure. Replace all placeholder paths (`[backend-dir]`, `[frontend-dir]`, `[pages-dir]`, `[components-dir]`, `[hooks-dir]`) with your project's actual paths. The scripts below use Convex + Next.js App Router paths as examples.

**IMPORTANT**: Before spawning any teammate, replace ALL `[backend-dir]`, `[frontend-dir]`, `[pages-dir]`, `[components-dir]`, and `[hooks-dir]` placeholders in the teammate instructions with the actual paths from `plancasting/tech-stack.md`.

- `convex/` → `[backend-dir]` (e.g., `convex/` for Convex, `server/` for Express, `api/` for Next.js API routes)
- `src/` → `[frontend-dir]` (e.g., `src/` for Next.js, `packages/web/` for monorepos, `app/` for some frameworks). This is the root directory containing all frontend source code.
- `src/app/` → `[pages-dir]` (e.g., `src/app/` for Next.js App Router, `pages/` for Pages Router)
- `src/components/features/` → `[components-dir]` (e.g., `src/components/features/`). Replace `[components-dir]` with your project's component directory from `plancasting/tech-stack.md` or `CLAUDE.md` Part 2 (e.g., `src/components/features/` for Next.js, `packages/web/app/components/` for monorepos).
- `src/hooks/` → `[hooks-dir]` (e.g., `src/hooks/`)
- `bun run` → your package manager command (e.g., `npm run`, `pnpm run`)
Always read `CLAUDE.md` for your project's actual conventions.

**Package Manager**: Commands in this prompt use `bun run` / `bunx` as the default. Replace with your project's package manager as specified in `CLAUDE.md` (e.g., `npm run` / `npx`, `pnpm run`, `yarn`).

## Agent Team Architecture

### Phase 1: Lead Analysis (BEFORE spawning teammates)

As the team lead, perform the full audit scan yourself before delegating fixes:

**Prerequisite Verification** (BEFORE any other steps):
- Verify `./plancasting/prd/` directory exists and contains markdown files. If missing, STOP: "Stage 5B requires completed PRD. Run Stages 1-2 first."
- Verify `./plancasting/_progress.md` exists. If missing, STOP: "Stage 5B requires `plancasting/_progress.md` from Stage 5. Run Stage 5 first."
- Verify source code directories exist (check `plancasting/tech-stack.md` for paths). If the project has no source code beyond scaffold, STOP: "Stage 5B requires Stage 5 implementation. Run Stage 5 first."
- Verify `./CLAUDE.md` exists. If missing, warn: 'CLAUDE.md not found — proceeding without project-specific conventions. Fix quality may be inconsistent.'

1. **Read project context**:
   - `./CLAUDE.md` — internalize all conventions
   - `./plancasting/tech-stack.md` — understand the stack
   - `./plancasting/_progress.md` — see what Stage 5 marked as "Done"
   - `./plancasting/_implementation-report.md` — see Stage 5's own assessment
   - `./plancasting/_briefs/` — read relevant feature briefs to understand Stage 5's planned implementation scope

2. **Build the Feature Inventory from PRD**:
   - Read `./plancasting/prd/02-feature-map-and-prioritization.md` — list ALL features
   - Read `./plancasting/prd/04-epics-and-user-stories.md` — list ALL user stories with acceptance criteria
   - Read `./plancasting/prd/08-screen-specifications.md` — list ALL screens that should exist
   - Read `./plancasting/prd/12-api-specifications.md` — list ALL API endpoints/functions that should exist
   - Create a master checklist: Feature → User Stories → Expected Screens → Expected Functions

3. **Run the Automated Stub Scan** across the ENTIRE codebase:

   ~~~

4. **Cross-reference PRD against implementation**:
   For EACH feature in the PRD:
   - Does the expected page route exist? Does it render real components?
   - Do the expected backend functions (e.g., Convex functions) exist? Do they have real logic (not just argument validation + return null)?
   - Do the expected UI components exist? Do they render interactive UI?
   - Do the expected hooks exist? Do they call real backend queries/mutations?
   - Does each acceptance criterion from user stories have corresponding UI behavior?

5. **Classify findings into three categories**:

   **Category A — Quick Fix (fix in-place, < 30 lines of code per file — count only executable code lines, excluding imports, comments, and whitespace)**:
   - Stub text replacement (placeholder → real content)
   - Missing onClick/onSubmit handlers (wire to existing hooks)
   - Missing loading/error/empty states (add using existing patterns)
   - Simple orphan cleanup (delete truly redundant component, or add one import to a page)
   - Missing i18n keys (add to messages file)
   - Dead href="#" links (replace with real routes)
   - Missing responsive classes

   **Category B — Medium Fix (fix in-place, 30–100 lines of code per file — same counting method as Category A, est. 15–45 min per file)**:
   - Components that need real UI built (replace scaffold body with functional component)
   - Hooks that need real data connections (replace useState mock with useQuery)
   - Forms that need real submission logic
   - Modals/dialogs that need real content and behavior
   - Pages that need to compose real components instead of inline placeholders
   - **Duplication fixes**: Page has inline UI + orphan component exists → move inline code into component, refactor page to import it
   - **Bloated page decomposition**: Page with 200+ lines of inline UI → extract into scaffold components

   **Workaround definition** (applies to all CONDITIONAL PASS paths): A workaround is a documented alternative path that allows end-users to accomplish the same business goal through different UI steps, API calls, or manual processes. The workaround must be (a) actionable by end-users without developer intervention, (b) documented with specific steps, and (c) functional in the current build. "Accept the limitation" or "defer to post-launch" is NOT a workaround — it is a deferral requiring explicit operator approval noted in the report.

   **Category C — Large Gap (document; 4–5 = FAIL-RETRY re-run 5B, 6+ = FAIL-ESCALATE re-run Stage 5)**: This threshold (1–3 Category C (with A/B ≤ 3 and each C with workaround) = CONDITIONAL PASS, 4–5 = FAIL-RETRY, 6+ Category C OR 6+ total unfixed = FAIL-ESCALATE — see Phase 4 for the full gate decision table; if both FAIL-RETRY and FAIL-ESCALATE thresholds are met simultaneously, FAIL-ESCALATE takes precedence) is a HARD gate. Do NOT classify 4 Category C issues as CONDITIONAL PASS. If a 4th Category C issue is found mid-audit, the gate automatically becomes FAIL. Escalate if ANY of these are true:
   1. Requires creating entirely new hooks or backend functions that the scaffold should have created but that don't exist. A hook/function "should have" been created if it maps to an API endpoint in `./plancasting/prd/12-api-specifications.md` or a component in `./plancasting/prd/08-screen-specifications.md` that needs to fetch/submit data. Check `plancasting/_scaffold-manifest.md` or `plancasting/_codegen-context.md` as the source of truth for what was scaffolded (PRD defines what should exist; the manifest defines what was created).
   2. A single file needs more than 100 lines of net-new code to complete a feature.
   3. Entire features where frontend is completely unbuilt — scaffold files exist but implementation is entirely missing. This indicates a Stage 5 session was interrupted or incompletely run. Escalate to the lead immediately.
   4. Features where both backend AND frontend are stubs — scaffold files exist but contain only placeholder logic (backend functions log "not implemented" and return empty data, AND frontend components render only placeholder divs with no real data bindings).
   - Features requiring significant new component architecture
   - Mark these in `plancasting/_progress.md` as 🔄 Needs Re-implementation with detailed notes

   **Note**: Category A/B/C in Stage 5B classify by CODE SIZE (lines per file). This differs from Stage 6V/6R, which classify by FIXABILITY (auto-fixable vs manual). Do not confuse the two systems — see execution-guide.md § "Gate Decision Outcomes" → "Category Systems" for the 6V/6R system.

   **Category C example**: `useUserProfile` hook is listed in `_codegen-context.md` but was never created. Creating it requires a new backend query, frontend hook, and 150+ lines of component code to consume it. This is NOT a stub fix — it's a missing feature requiring Stage 5 re-implementation.

   **Multi-file classification rule**: Category A — all files need <30 lines each. Category B — largest file needs <100 lines AND total across all files <150 lines. Category C — largest file needs ≥100 lines OR total ≥150 lines across all affected files. If ambiguous, default to the higher category. If multiple independent issues happen to be in the same feature, classify each issue separately.

   **Fixing Priority Within A/B Categories**: (1) Fix issues in P0/P1 critical user flows first. (2) Then fix P2/P3 flow issues. (3) Within each flow, fix backend issues before frontend (frontend may depend on backend being correct). (4) Within each layer, fix integration gaps before stubs (a component can't be functional if it depends on missing backend functions).

6. **Generate the audit report**: Save to `./plancasting/_audits/implementation-completeness/report.md`
   - Total issues found per category (A / B / C)
   - Issues broken down by feature
   - Files affected
   - Estimated fix scope

7. **Create the fix plan**: Determine teammate assignments based on findings.

### Phase 2: Spawn Fix Teammates

Spawn Teammates 1 and 2 first (they can run in parallel). Teammate 3 (e2e-verification) MUST be spawned only AFTER Teammates 1 and 2 complete their work — it validates their fixes.

Based on findings, spawn up to 3 teammates. If no issues are found in a category, skip that teammate.

**Early exit decision table**:

**Note**: This table applies when determining whether to spawn Phase 2 teammates. It covers the early-exit cases where no teammate spawning is needed. If Category A/B issues ARE found (count >= 1), proceed to Phase 2 teammate spawning regardless of this table — the table only applies to the zero-A/B-issues rows.

| Category A/B count | Category C count | Gate Decision | Lead Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | **PASS** | Skip Phase 2/3. Generate report. Proceed to Stage 6. |
| 0 | 1–3 | **CONDITIONAL PASS** | Skip Phase 2/3. Generate report with Category C list (each with documented workaround). Document in `_progress.md`. Proceed to Stage 6. |
| 0 | 4–5 | **FAIL-RETRY** | Skip Phase 2/3. Generate report. Operator must manually fix Category C issues or set `🔄` in `_progress.md`, then re-run 5B to verify reduction. Simply re-running 5B without operator intervention will not reduce Category C count. |
| 0 | 6+ (or total unfixed >= 6) | **FAIL-ESCALATE** | Skip Phase 2/3. Generate report with Category C list. Document in `_progress.md`. STOP — instruct operator to re-run Stage 5 for affected features. |
| 1+ | any | *(determined after fixes)* | Spawn Phase 2 teammates to fix A/B. Document Category C in `_progress.md`. After Phase 3, proceed to Phase 4 for gate decision. |
| any (Run 4+) | any | **FAIL-ESCALATE** | Run 4+ reached. Skip Phase 2 auto-fixes. Reclassify all remaining A/B issues as Category C. Proceed to Phase 4 to generate report with FAIL-ESCALATE gate. Set `🔄` in `_progress.md` for affected features. |

**Per-feature escalation rule**: If a single feature (same FEAT-ID) reports FAIL-RETRY three consecutive times across separate 5B runs (not Stage 5 re-runs), that feature automatically escalates to FAIL-ESCALATE regardless of overall category counts. A Stage 5 re-run for a feature resets that feature's consecutive FAIL-RETRY counter to 0 (the feature has been re-implemented). "Three consecutive times" means three 5B runs where that specific feature returned FAIL-RETRY — other features' results and intervening PASS/CONDITIONAL PASS outcomes for OTHER features are irrelevant. **Reading previous run state**: At the start of Phase 1, read the previous audit report at `./plancasting/_audits/implementation-completeness/report.md` if it exists — extract the per-feature `5B Runs` column to continue tracking consecutive FAIL-RETRY counts. If no previous report exists, this is Run 1. Track per-feature run counts in the audit report's feature table using a `5B Runs` column (e.g., `FEAT-003: 5B-run-1=FAIL-RETRY, 5B-run-2=FAIL-RETRY, 5B-run-3=FAIL-RETRY → ESCALATE`). This prevents infinite retry loops on features that consistently fail due to deeper architectural issues. Note: this is independent of the global Run Number (Run 4+ rule); a feature can escalate at global Run 2 if it has individually failed 3 times across prior runs.

**Note**: This table determines whether Phase 2 teammate spawning is necessary. Phase 4 (report generation) and Phase 5 (rule extraction) ALWAYS run regardless of early exit — the report is required by downstream stages (6A–6G, 6H), and rule extraction captures any patterns found during the Phase 1 scan even if no fixes were needed. Save the report to `./plancasting/_audits/implementation-completeness/report.md` with the gate decision and Category C details.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Everything below this line is TEAMMATE instructions, not lead instructions. The lead spawns these teammates AFTER completing Phase 1. Do NOT execute teammate instructions yourself — delegate them.**

#### Teammate 1: "frontend-stub-fixer" (PRIMARY — spawned first when fixes needed)
**Scope**: Fix all Category A and Category B frontend issues

~~~
You are fixing frontend implementation gaps found during the Stage 5B completeness audit.

Read CLAUDE.md first (especially Frontend Rules and Design & Visual Identity sections).
Check `./plancasting/tech-stack.md` for the `Session Language` setting. Code remains in English; report messages and user-facing strings follow the session language.
Also read `./plancasting/tech-stack.md` for the design direction and UI component library.
Read the audit report at ./plancasting/_audits/implementation-completeness/report.md.

YOUR MANDATE: Replace every stub with a FUNCTIONAL implementation. You are NOT writing new features — the backend is already complete. You are connecting frontend components to the existing backend.

**CRITICAL BOUNDARY**: If a component needs a backend **mutation/query/action function** that doesn't exist in the backend directory, DO NOT create it — report as Category C. Missing backend functions indicate Stage 3 or Stage 5 incompleteness. However, if the backend function EXISTS but a frontend **hook wrapper** is missing (the function is in the backend but no `useXxx` hook wraps it), you MAY create the hook if it is <100 lines — this is a scaffold gap, not a backend gap.

## How to Fix Each Pattern

### Stub Components (scaffold body → real UI)
1. Read the feature brief at ./plancasting/_briefs/<feature-id>.md for what this component should do. If no brief exists, read `./plancasting/prd/02-feature-map-and-prioritization.md` and `./plancasting/prd/04-epics-and-user-stories.md` to understand what this feature should do.
2. Read the screen specification in ./plancasting/prd/08-screen-specifications.md for the expected UI.
3. Read the existing hook in [hooks-dir] (e.g., src/hooks/) that provides data for this component.
4. Implement the FULL component:
   - Import and use the correct hook
   - Render all states: loading (skeleton), error (error boundary), empty (guidance + CTA), data (full UI)
   - Add all interactive elements from the screen spec (buttons, forms, links)
   - Wire interactions to hook mutations/actions
   - Add ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
   - Use design tokens from [styles-dir]/design-tokens.ts (e.g., src/styles/design-tokens.ts) — no hardcoded colors
   - Implement responsive behavior (not just column stacking)

### Unconnected Hooks (useState → useQuery)
1. Find the correct custom hook in [hooks-dir] (e.g., src/hooks/) for this data.
2. Replace useState/mock data with the hook's return value.
3. Add loading/error state handling from the hook.
4. If the hook doesn't exist, check if it's listed in `_codegen-context.md` or `_scaffold-manifest.md`. If listed (should have been scaffolded), escalate as Category C. If not listed (genuinely new need discovered during implementation), create it if <100 lines; otherwise escalate as Category C.

### Dead Handlers (noop → real)
1. Find the mutation/action that this handler should call (check [hooks-dir] (e.g., src/hooks/) and [backend-dir] (e.g., convex/)).
2. Wire the handler to call the correct mutation with correct arguments.
3. Add optimistic updates if the hook supports them.
4. Add error handling (toast notification or inline error).

### Missing States
1. Add loading state: use Skeleton components matching the component's layout.
2. Add error state: use the ErrorDisplay component with retry action.
3. Add empty state: use EmptyState component with icon, message, and CTA button.
4. Follow patterns from already-completed feature components.

### Orphan Components
- If the component SHOULD be rendered: find the correct page and import it.
- If the page already implements the UI inline: DELETE the orphan file. (Verify no other files import the orphan before deleting. If other files do import it, resolve those imports first.)
- If the component duplicates another: DELETE and update imports.

### Duplication Pattern (inline page UI + orphan component)
This is NOT the same as a stub. The component file has a real (or scaffold) body AND the page has inline UI for the same purpose. Fix strategy:
1. Read both the page file and the orphan component file.
2. Determine which has the BETTER implementation (usually the page's inline version, since Stage 5 wrote it).
3. Move the better implementation INTO the scaffold component file (preserving the component's file location and exports).
4. Refactor the page to import and render the component instead of inline UI.
5. Delete the inline UI from the page. The page should compose components, not contain business logic.
6. Verify the component is imported and rendered correctly.
This preserves the architectural intent (pages compose components) while keeping the working code.

### Bloated Pages (monolithic page → component composition)
Pages with 200+ lines that contain inline hooks, state, and JSX should be decomposed:
1. Identify logical sections in the page (each with its own hooks/state).
2. Check if scaffold component files exist for those sections (check `plancasting/_scaffold-manifest.md`).
3. Move each section into its corresponding scaffold component.
4. The page should import and compose these components, passing only the props they need.

### Missing i18n Keys
- Add all missing translation keys to the project's i18n message file (check CLAUDE.md or `plancasting/tech-stack.md` for the actual path — common locations: `src/messages/en.json`, `src/locales/en.ts`, `public/locales/en/common.json`).
- Follow the existing key naming convention.

## VERIFICATION (non-negotiable)
After ALL fixes are applied, if any test fails, diagnose each failure: (a) if caused by a fix you just applied (new behavior replacing a stub), update the test to match the new behavior; (b) if a genuine regression (a fix broke unrelated code), escalate to the lead immediately with details. Do NOT skip or delete failing tests.

Set `FRONTEND_DIR` to your frontend root (e.g., `FRONTEND_DIR=src/`) and `BACKEND_DIR` to your actual backend directory path (e.g., `BACKEND_DIR=convex/`) before running these commands.

1. Run the full stub scan again:
   grep -rn "implementation pending\|pending feature build\|⚠️ STUB\|TODO \[Stage 5\]\|Coming soon\|Not yet implemented\|PLACEHOLDER" "$FRONTEND_DIR" "$BACKEND_DIR" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" --include="*.jsx" --include="*.js" | grep -v 'placeholder="\|Placeholder='
   MUST return zero results.
2. Run typecheck: e.g., bun run typecheck — zero errors (adapt to your package manager per CLAUDE.md).
3. Run lint: e.g., bun run lint — zero errors (adapt to your package manager per CLAUDE.md).
4. Run frontend tests: e.g., bun run test -- src/ — all pass (adapt to your package manager per CLAUDE.md).
5. Verify no orphan components remain (re-run the orphan scan).

When done, message the lead with:
- Number of components fixed (Category A + B)
- Number of orphan files deleted
- Number of i18n keys added
- Files modified (full list)
- Any Category C issues discovered during fixing (components that need more than 100 lines)
- Verification results (stub scan, typecheck, lint, tests)
~~~

#### Teammate 2: "backend-stub-fixer" (if backend issues found)
**Scope**: Fix all backend stubs and integration gaps

~~~
You are fixing backend implementation gaps found during the Stage 5B completeness audit.

Read CLAUDE.md first (especially Backend Rules).
Check `./plancasting/tech-stack.md` for the `Session Language` setting. Code remains in English; report messages follow the session language.
Read the audit report at ./plancasting/_audits/implementation-completeness/report.md — focus on the backend and integration sections.

YOUR MANDATE: Every backend function (e.g., Convex function) must have REAL business logic, not placeholder returns.

## Fix Patterns

### Action Stubs (log → real API call)
1. Read the feature brief for what this action should do.
2. Read the BRD business rules for validation requirements.
3. Implement the actual external API call with proper error handling.
4. Add retry logic for transient failures.

### Missing Validation
1. Read brd/14-business-rules-and-logic.md for the rules.
2. Add proper error throws with your backend error type (e.g., `ConvexError` for Convex) and error codes from your error codes module.
3. Add argument validation with your backend's validators (e.g., `v` validators for Convex).

### Integration Gaps
1. Verify cross-feature data flows work (Feature A → Feature B).
2. Fix queries that should aggregate data from multiple features but only query one.
3. Fix mutations that should trigger side effects in other features but don't.

## VERIFICATION
1. Run backend dev server (or equivalent backend validation command per tech-stack.md; e.g., `bunx convex dev`, `bun run dev:backend`, `npx prisma validate`, etc.) to verify all functions deploy.
2. Run backend tests: bun run test -- [your backend test directory] (e.g., `convex/__tests__/`) — all pass.
3. Verify all function exports match what frontend hooks expect.

When done, message the lead with:
- Number of functions fixed
- Files modified
- Any new error codes added
- Verification results
~~~

#### Teammate 3: "e2e-verification" (always run last)
**Scope**: Run full E2E suite to verify fixes don't break anything

~~~
You are running the final verification after Stage 5B fixes have been applied.

Read CLAUDE.md first (especially the Commands and Testing sections).
Check `./plancasting/tech-stack.md` for the `Session Language` setting. Report messages follow the session language.

Note: E2E tests require a running dev server. Check CLAUDE.md for the dev server port. First check if one is already running (`lsof -ti:<port>`). If not, start it: `bun run dev &` (or equivalent per CLAUDE.md). Wait for the server to be ready: `bunx wait-on http://localhost:<port> --timeout 60000` (or poll with `until curl -s http://localhost:<port> > /dev/null 2>&1; do sleep 1; done`). Stop the dev server after verification: `lsof -ti:<port> | xargs kill 2>/dev/null`.

Your tasks:
1. Run the FULL test suite (use your project's package manager per CLAUDE.md):
   - bun run typecheck
   - bun run lint
   - bun run test (all unit + integration)
   - bun run test:e2e (all E2E)

2. For any test failures:
   - **Test was mocking old behavior** that no longer exists (e.g., test checks for "Loading..." but component now shows "Processing...") → UPDATE the mock/assertion to match new behavior.
   - **Component interface changed** (props renamed, return type changed) → UPDATE the test assertions to match the new interface.
   - **A feature that was working before is now broken** (e.g., a query hook returns null when it should return data) → REPORT to the lead immediately as a genuine regression.
   To distinguish: read the test failure message and the code change side-by-side. Interface changes (cases 1-2) show assertion mismatches; regressions (case 3) show functional failures.

3. Run a FINAL stub scan across the entire project (set `FRONTEND_DIR` to your frontend root, e.g., `FRONTEND_DIR=src/`, and `BACKEND_DIR` to your actual backend directory path, e.g., `BACKEND_DIR=convex/`, before running):
   grep -rn "implementation pending\|pending feature build\|⚠️ STUB\|TODO \[Stage 5\]\|Coming soon\|Not yet implemented\|PLACEHOLDER" "$FRONTEND_DIR" "$BACKEND_DIR" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" --include="*.jsx" --include="*.js" | grep -v 'placeholder="\|Placeholder='
   This MUST return zero results. All features in `./plancasting/prd/02-feature-map-and-prioritization.md` are in current build scope per the Transmute full-build approach. The only acceptable stubs are in utility or helper files that are not directly user-facing (e.g., placeholder analytics wrappers, optional integration hooks).

4. Run an orphan component scan and report any remaining orphans.
   This scan may produce false positives for dynamically imported components (`React.lazy`, `next/dynamic`). Before deleting an apparent orphan, also check for `dynamic(() => import(` and `lazy(() => import(` patterns referencing the component.

5. Spot-check ALL pages that had Category B fixes applied, plus additional random pages. Coverage by feature count: <10 features → spot-check all pages; 10–30 features → spot-check 50% (every 2nd page alphabetically) plus all Category B pages; >30 features → spot-check 30% (every 3rd page alphabetically) plus all Category B pages. For each page, verify:
   a. Open the page source file (e.g., `src/app/.../page.tsx`)
   b. Verify it has component imports from `[components-dir]` (not all UI inline)
   c. Verify it does NOT have raw `useState()` hooks for data that should be server-derived
   d. Verify the page JSX renders the imported components (not commented out)
   e. Verify sibling files `loading.tsx` and `error.tsx` exist (if applicable per tech-stack.md)
   f. Run the app and navigate to the page — verify it loads without blank screens or console errors
   g. Verify responsive behavior at 3 breakpoints (375px mobile, 768px tablet, 1440px desktop). If a dev server is running and Playwright is available, use viewport sizing for verification. Otherwise, verify responsive CSS classes/media queries exist in the source code (check for `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` breakpoint prefixes or equivalent `@media` queries). Flag components that break layout or overflow at mobile width as Category A (add responsive CSS) or Category B (needs layout refactor).

When done, message the lead using this exact format:
- TypeScript: ✅ / ❌ ([n] errors)
- Lint: ✅ / ❌ ([n] errors)
- Unit Tests: ✅ / ❌ ([n] pass, [n] fail)
- E2E Tests: ✅ / ❌ ([n] pass, [n] fail)
- Stub scan: ✅ / ❌ ([n] remaining stubs)
- Orphan scan: ✅ / ❌ ([n] orphans)
- Spot-check results
- Any remaining issues
~~~

### Phase 3: Coordination

**Mandatory file conflict prevention**: Before spawning, assign mutually exclusive file sets to Teammates 1 and 2. If shared files exist (type definitions, shared utilities, barrel exports), assign them to Teammate 1 (frontend) exclusively — Teammate 2 (backend) MUST NOT modify frontend-owned files. If Teammate 2 discovers a type mismatch in a shared file, report it to the lead for manual fix after Teammate 1 completes. For files in the backend directory, Teammate 2 has exclusive ownership. For shared files, Teammate 2 should read the latest version after Teammate 1 completes.

While teammates work (this phase runs concurrently with Phase 2):
1. After each teammate completes, review their completion message for Category C escalations — if found, document them in `plancasting/_progress.md`. After both Teammates 1 and 2 report completion, spawn Teammate 3 (e2e-verification).
2. If the FAIL-ESCALATE gate is triggered (6+ Category C issues, OR 6+ total unfixed issues, OR 3 consecutive per-feature FAIL-RETRY outcomes for the same FEAT-ID (tracked per-feature, not globally)), add a note to the audit report recommending a FULL Stage 5 re-run for affected features rather than targeted fixes — this volume of Category C issues indicates systemic frontend failure, not just isolated gaps. For FAIL-RETRY (4–5 Category C), recommend re-running 5B with targeted fixes.
3. Resolve any conflicts between backend and frontend fixes. If teammates 1 and 2 modify the same file, the lead must review both change sets and merge. If a teammate is stuck on a fix exceeding Category B scope (needs >100 lines of new code), reclassify as Category C and move on.

### Phase 4: Audit Report & Gate Decision

After all teammates complete:

1. **Ensure output directory exists**: `mkdir -p ./plancasting/_audits/implementation-completeness/`

2. **Update the audit report** at `./plancasting/_audits/implementation-completeness/report.md`:

   ~~~markdown
   # Implementation Completeness Audit Report — Stage 5B

   ## Summary
   - **Audit Date**: [date]
   - **Run Number**: [1 | 2 | 3 | 4+]
   - **Total Issues Found**: [N]
     - Category A (Quick Fix): [n] → [n] fixed
     - Category B (Medium Fix): [n] → [n] fixed
     - Category C (Needs Re-implementation): [n] → escalated to plancasting/_progress.md
   - **Frontend Issues**: [n] (expected to be the majority)
   - **Backend Issues**: [n]
   - **Integration Issues**: [n]

   ## Fix Summary
   - Components fixed: [n]
   - Orphan files deleted: [n]
   - i18n keys added: [n]
   - Backend functions fixed: [n]
   - Files modified: [total]

   ## Verification Results
   - TypeScript: ✅ / ❌ (0 errors)
   - Lint: ✅ / ❌ (0 errors)
   - Unit Tests: ✅ / ❌ ([n] pass, [n] fail)
   - E2E Tests: ✅ / ❌ ([n] pass, [n] fail)
   - Stub Scan: ✅ / ❌ (0 remaining stubs)
   - Orphan Scan: ✅ / ❌ (0 orphan components)

   ## Gate Decision
   Gate decision is evaluated in priority order: PASS first, then CONDITIONAL PASS, then FAIL-RETRY, then FAIL-ESCALATE. The first matching outcome applies.
   - **PASS**: All Category A/B fixed, zero Category C issues, all tests pass, zero stubs remain, zero orphan components remain → proceed to Stage 6
   - **CONDITIONAL PASS**: Applies when ANY of these conditions is met (check in order, first match wins):
     (a) All A/B fixed, 1–3 Category C documented with clear descriptions and workarounds → proceed to Stage 6
     (b) 1–3 A/B remain unfixed (each documented with either a code workaround, a user-facing alternative, OR an accepted limitation with explicit operator approval noted in the report), zero Category C → proceed to Stage 6
     (c) BOTH unfixed A/B AND Category C exist: CONDITIONAL PASS only if A/B ≤ 3 AND Category C ≤ 3 (each with documented workaround); otherwise → evaluate FAIL-RETRY/FAIL-ESCALATE conditions below (total unfixed ≥ 6 → FAIL-ESCALATE, not FAIL-RETRY)
     Proceed to Stage 6 with known gaps noted in the report
   - **FAIL-RETRY** (re-run 5B): ANY of: (a) 4+ Category A/B issues remain unfixed (without workarounds), (b) test failures from 5B fixes, (c) 4–5 Category C issues (exceeds the 3 max for CONDITIONAL PASS but below systemic failure threshold), (d) total unfixed (A/B + C) 4–5 (exceeds CONDITIONAL PASS mixed threshold). Before re-running, diagnose WHY the fix failed (missing backend dependency, incorrect hook API, type mismatch) — re-running without diagnosis will loop. Maximum 3 total 5B runs (Run 1 = initial, Run 2 = first re-run, Run 3 = second re-run). Run 4+ = escalation. If A/B issues persist after Run 3 (third attempt), escalate all remaining A/B issues to Category C. If this is Run 4+ (check the Run Number in the existing report), skip Phase 2 and escalate all remaining A/B issues to Category C in Phase 4.
   - **FAIL-ESCALATE** (re-run Stage 5): 6+ Category C issues, OR 6+ total unfixed issues across all categories combined AFTER Phase 2/3 fix attempts (i.e., remaining unfixed A/B that Phase 2 could not resolve + all Category C), OR 3 consecutive FAIL-RETRY outcomes for the same feature (indicates systemic implementation failure)
   - **FAIL recovery actions**: Specific steps by failure type:
     - **Unfixed A/B issues**: Diagnose the root cause, then re-run Stage 5B with targeted fixes for the specific files
     - **4–5 Category C issues**: Operator should manually address or set affected features to `🔄 Needs Re-implementation` in `_progress.md`, then re-run 5B to re-scan. 5B cannot fix Category C issues itself — the re-run verifies operator fixes reduced the count. If Category C count still exceeds 3 after operator intervention, escalate to FAIL-ESCALATE
     - **6+ Category C issues**: Set affected features to `🔄 Needs Re-implementation` in `_progress.md`, re-run Stage 5 for those features, then re-run Stage 5B
     - **Test failures**: Diagnose regression source — if caused by 5B fixes, fix the tests; if pre-existing, escalate to Stage 5 re-run

   ## Category C Escalations (if any)
   [List features that need Stage 5 re-run with specific gaps described]

   ## Per-Feature 5B History
   | Feature ID | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Escalation |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   [Track per-feature outcomes across 5B runs — 3 consecutive FAIL-RETRY for a single feature triggers automatic FAIL-ESCALATE]

   ## Issues by Feature
   [Detailed breakdown per feature]
   ~~~

3. **Update `plancasting/_progress.md`**:
   - Mark any Category C features as 🔄 Needs Re-implementation
   - Add a "Stage 5B Audit" section noting the audit date and result

4. **Gate Decision**:
   - If **PASS** or **CONDITIONAL PASS**: Stage 6 can proceed.
   - If **FAIL-RETRY**: Output the diagnosis and STOP. The operator should address issues, then re-run 5B.
   - If **FAIL-ESCALATE**: Output the list of features needing re-implementation and STOP. The operator must re-run Stage 5 for those features before proceeding.

### Phase 5: Rule Extraction (Post-Gate)

After the gate decision but before the final commit, extract implementation lessons as path-scoped rules. See CLAUDE.md § 'Path-Scoped Rules' for the full specification. If `plancasting/_rules-candidates.md` does not exist, create it with the standard header from the template before appending candidates.

1. **Scan audit findings for repeatable patterns**:
   - Review all Category A/B issues that were fixed. Group by root cause pattern (e.g., "missing soft-delete filter in 4 queries", "useState instead of useQuery in 3 components").
   - Review Category C issues for tech-stack limitations (e.g., "Convex does not support server-side redirects").
   - Only extract patterns that are tech-stack-specific and generalizable — not one-off bugs.

2. **Generate rule candidates** with structured format:
   For each pattern found, create a candidate entry:
   ~~~markdown
   ### [Pattern Title]
   - **Source Stage**: 5B
   - **Evidence**: [Category/finding IDs, e.g., "Category B #3, #7, #12 — all missing soft-delete filter"]
   - **Trigger**: [What file paths/patterns trigger this rule]
   - **Rule Text**: [Concise directive — max 3 sentences]
   - **Target File**: [Which .claude/rules/ file this belongs in, e.g., backend.md]
   - **Confidence**: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
   - **Affected Features**: [FEAT-IDs where this pattern appeared]
   ~~~

3. **Classify confidence and route**:
   - **HIGH** (2+ distinct features affected with clear pattern — occurrences within the same feature count as 1 feature): Append the rule directly to the appropriate `.claude/rules/*.md` file. Include the evidence comment.
   - **MEDIUM** (single feature but generalizable): Append the candidate to `plancasting/_rules-candidates.md`.
   - **LOW** (edge case or uncertain): Append the candidate to `plancasting/_rules-candidates.md`.

4. **Update ONLY CLAUDE.md Part 2** Path-Scoped Rules table with updated rule counts if any HIGH confidence rules were added. Do NOT modify Part 1.

5. **Include in commit**: Stage the updated `.claude/rules/` files and `plancasting/_rules-candidates.md` in the audit commit.

> **Limits**: Respect the limits from CLAUDE.md: max 15 rules per file, max 8 rule files total.

### Phase 6: Shutdown
1. Verify all teammates have completed their tasks and terminated.
2. Output final summary: gate decision, issues fixed, any escalations, rules extracted (count by confidence level).

## Critical Rules

1. NEVER skip the automated stub scan. It is the objective foundation of this audit. The scan catches explicit text-pattern stubs (high confidence). THEN manually review components with fewer than 20 lines by cross-referencing the PRD screen specification: a thin component is a stub only if it implements fewer states/interactions than the spec requires. A legitimately simple read-only widget may be under 20 lines and NOT a stub. Also check components that import hooks but don't use their return values.
2. NEVER mark a stub as "acceptable" — stubs are ALWAYS bugs at this stage. The only acceptable "Coming soon" is for features explicitly marked as future scope in the PRD (not in the current feature map).
3. NEVER delete test files to make the suite pass. Fix the code, not the tests.
4. ALWAYS read the feature brief and PRD screen spec before fixing a component — understand what it SHOULD do before writing code.
5. ALWAYS follow CLAUDE.md conventions when writing fix code — this is not a shortcut stage.
6. ALWAYS run the full verification suite before declaring the audit complete.
7. Frontend fixes are the PRIMARY focus. Allocate 70% of effort to frontend-stub-fixer.
8. If a component fix requires backend changes that don't exist, this is a Category C issue — do NOT create backend stubs to unblock frontend.
9. The goal is NOT perfection — it is completeness. Every feature should be FUNCTIONAL. Polish happens in Stage 6.
10. This stage should fix, not redesign. Maintain the architectural decisions made in Stage 5.

**5B Quality Standard**: 5B fixes should bring components from 'scaffold' to 'working' — happy path complete, loading/error states present, no obvious bugs. This is NOT production polish (Stage 6P handles that). The bar is: 'does this work as described in the PRD?'
````
