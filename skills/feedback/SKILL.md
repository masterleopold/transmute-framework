# User Feedback Loop — Stage 8

## Critical Concept: Living Documents

The BRD and PRD are NOT frozen artifacts. They are living documents that evolve with the product. This skill maintains the chain: Feedback -> Spec Update -> Code Change -> Test Update -> Doc Update, ensuring every layer stays consistent.

## Prerequisites

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` and `plancasting/tech-stack.md`.
2. Verify Stage 7V PASS: Check that `./plancasting/_audits/production-smoke/report.md` exists and shows PASS. If missing or FAIL, STOP -- Stage 7V must pass before processing feedback.
3. Verify `./feedback/input.md` exists. If not, stop: "No feedback to process. Create `./feedback/input.md` with feedback items before running Stage 8. Schedule Stage 8 after feedback batch is collected."
4. **Input Validation**: Verify `./feedback/input.md` follows the required structure. Required fields per feedback item: (1) ID (TICKET-001, etc.), (2) Category (Bug / UX Issue / Missing Feature / Enhancement / Performance / Documentation), (3) Description, (4) Affected Feature ID (FEAT-XXX or NEW). If required fields are missing, ask operator to provide them before Phase 1 begins.
5. Check `plancasting/tech-stack.md` for the `Session Language` setting. Generate all reports in the specified language.

## Inputs

- **User Feedback**: `./feedback/input.md` (structured feedback -- see format below)
- **Existing Specs**: `./plancasting/brd/`, `./plancasting/prd/`
- **Tech Stack**: `./plancasting/tech-stack.md`
- **Codebase**: Backend directory, `./src/`, `./e2e/` (adapt to your stack)
- **Project Rules**: `./CLAUDE.md`
- **Progress Tracker**: `./plancasting/_progress.md` (if exists)
- **User Guide** (if exists): `./user-guide/` (Mintlify docs from Stage 7D)
- **Feedback Archive** (if exists): `./feedback/archive/` -- review for recurring feedback

## Stack Adaptation

Examples use Convex + Next.js paths. Adapt to your stack:
- `convex/` -> your backend directory
- `src/` -> your frontend directory
- `npm run` -> your package manager command
Always read `CLAUDE.md` and `plancasting/tech-stack.md` for actual conventions.

## Preparing the Feedback Input

Create `./feedback/input.md` with structured feedback:

```markdown
# User Feedback Batch — [Date]

## Source: Support Tickets (Jan 15-31)

### TICKET-001: Users cannot find the export function
- **Frequency**: 12 tickets in 2 weeks
- **User Quote**: "I've looked everywhere but can't figure out how to export my data"
- **Affected Feature**: Data Export (FEAT-015)

## Source: Analytics (Jan 1-31)

### ANALYTICS-001: 60% drop-off on onboarding step 3
- **Metric**: Funnel completion rate
- **Current**: 40% complete onboarding
- **Target**: 80% (from PRD)

## Source: Stakeholder Request

### STAKEHOLDER-001: Add bulk delete capability
- **Requester**: Operations Team Lead
- **Justification**: "Manually deleting items one by one is taking hours"
- **Priority Request**: High
```

## Session Recovery

If this stage is interrupted mid-execution:
1. Check if `./feedback/analysis.md` exists -- if so, Phase 1 (triage) completed. Skip to Phase 2.
2. Check if `./feedback/change-plan.md` exists -- if so, the change plan is ready. Skip to spawning teammates.
3. Check if code changes exist beyond spec updates -- review `git diff` to understand what was changed, then resume from the incomplete teammate.
4. If `./feedback/resolution.md` exists with a complete summary -- Phase 4 completed. The stage is done.
5. If none of the above files exist, restart from Phase 1.

**Warning**: Partial spec updates without corresponding code changes leave the project in an inconsistent state. MUST complete Phase 3 before ending the recovery session.

## Execution Flow

### Phase 1: Lead Analysis — Feedback Triage

**Branch safety**: Verify `git status` shows a clean working directory before creating the branch -- commit or stash uncommitted changes first. Then create a dedicated branch: `git checkout -b feedback/batch-$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S)`. The HMS suffix avoids same-day collisions.

1. Read `./CLAUDE.md`, `./plancasting/tech-stack.md`, and `./feedback/input.md`.
2. Read `./plancasting/prd/_context.md` (or `plancasting/prd/README.md`) and `./plancasting/brd/_context.md` (or `plancasting/brd/00-cover-and-metadata.md`) for existing feature inventory. Extract maximum existing requirement IDs (max FR-NNN, max US-NNN, max SC-NNN, etc.) and include in `change-plan.md` so Teammate 1 knows the starting point for new IDs.
3. **Categorize each feedback item**:

   | Category | Description | Action |
   |---|---|---|
   | Bug | Product doesn't match existing spec | Fix code to match spec |
   | UX Issue | Product matches spec but spec is wrong | Update spec + fix code |
   | Missing Feature | Capability not in current spec | Add to spec + implement |
   | Performance | Doesn't meet NFR targets | Optimize (use Stage 6C) |
   | Enhancement | Existing feature needs improvement | Update spec + modify code |
   | Documentation | User guide unclear, missing, or incorrect | Update `user-guide/` and `docs/` |

4. **Trace to existing specs**: For each item, find related PRD feature/user story/screen spec, BRD requirement, and code files.
   - Check `./plancasting/brd/14-business-rules-and-logic.md` and `./plancasting/brd/06-business-requirements.md` for rules that might conflict
   - **Decision audit**: If implementing would change a specification marked as a key constraint in Stage 1/2, escalate as `STAKEHOLDER_DECISION_REQUIRED`
   - **Recurring request check**: Review `./feedback/archive/` (if exists) to identify recurring feedback. If the same request appears in 2+ feedback batches, increase priority by 1 tier (P2->P1, P1->P0). Cap at P0. Document: "Priority bumped due to [N] recurring requests across [batch dates]."

5. Create `./feedback/analysis.md` with triage table, impact assessment, and effort estimates (XS <15 min / S 15-30 min / M 30-60 min / L 1-2 hours / XL 2-4 hours).

   **Batch limit**: If APPROVED items exceed the feedback batch limit (check `tech-stack.md` § Model Specifications "Feedback batch limit"; default: 15 items), split into priority-ordered batches. Process only the first batch. **Effort-based splitting**: If estimated effort for the batch exceeds 3-5 hours, split into sub-batches by priority tier.

### Conflict Detection and Resolution

Before creating the change plan, scan for conflicting feedback items:
1. Group feedback by affected feature (FEAT-NNN)
2. Within each group, check for opposing requests (simplify vs add options, remove vs enhance)
3. Classify the conflict type to determine resolution strategy:
   - **Simplicity vs Power**: Design decision -- often resolvable via feature-flag by plan tier
   - **UX vs Performance**: Trade-off decision -- benchmark both before choosing
   - **Safety vs Convenience**: Policy decision -- escalate to stakeholder, don't guess
   - **Quantitative conflict** (80% want A, 20% want B): frequency wins; document minority concern
   - **Qualitative conflict** (both sides have merit, no clear majority): escalate or propose A/B test
4. Document the conflict type, resolution strategy, and rationale in the change plan
5. Unresolvable conflicts: mark as `STAKEHOLDER_DECISION_REQUIRED` and defer both items

**Escalation procedure for deferred conflicts**: Document both sides in `change-plan.md` with rationale and impact assessment. Mark as `[STAKEHOLDER DECISION REQUIRED]`. Set a 48-hour deadline for stakeholder decisions. If no decision by deadline, set status to `DEFERRED -- Next batch [DATE]`.

**Spec file limit**: If a single item requires changes to >5 spec files (BRD + PRD combined), flag as 'complex' and recommend a dedicated session.

6. **Assign status markers**: `APPROVED`, `STAKEHOLDER_DECISION_REQUIRED`, or `DEFERRED`. Include in change plan. Each entry MUST include a `Status:` field so teammates can check it before starting work.

7. Create `./feedback/change-plan.md` with ordered changes list. Each entry includes: status marker, spec changes, code changes, test changes, documentation changes, task dependency mapping.

8. Create task list for teammates.

### Phase 2: Spawn Improvement Teammates

**Prerequisite check**: Before spawning Teammate 1, verify `./feedback/change-plan.md` exists and contains at least one APPROVED item. If not, STOP and re-run Phase 1.

Spawn 3 teammates SEQUENTIALLY (spec -> code -> test/docs). Each teammate skips items marked `STAKEHOLDER_DECISION_REQUIRED` or `DEFERRED`.

**Teammate 1 -- "spec-updater"**: Update BRD and PRD based on feedback. Add new requirements with next available IDs. Modify acceptance criteria. Add traceability markers (`Updated based on user feedback [TICKET-001]`). Update version tracking in cover/metadata files. Run consistency check after all updates.

**Teammate 2 -- "code-implementer"** (BLOCKED by Teammate 1): Implement code changes against updated specs. Fix bugs to match spec. Modify UI/backend for UX issues and enhancements. Implement missing features. Add traceability comments (`// FEEDBACK FIX: [feedback-id]`). The `FEEDBACK FIX` comment supplements (does not replace) the standard `@traces` header. Run `build` to catch build-breaking issues before Teammate 3.

**Teammate 3 -- "test-and-docs-updater"** (BLOCKED by Teammate 2): Update existing tests to match new specs. Add new tests for each new feature/behavior. Update developer docs (`./docs/`). Update user guide only if `./user-guide/` directory exists -- journey pages, FAQ, troubleshooting, changelog, validate docs.json navigation. If multi-language, update BOTH `en/` and `<session-lang>/` versions. If no user guide exists, focus on `./docs/` and `./e2e/` instead. Run full verification suite: typecheck, lint, test, test:e2e, build.

### Phase 3: Coordination During Execution

1. Monitor progress.
2. Enforce dependency ordering -- Teammate 2 starts only after Teammate 1 completes, Teammate 3 after Teammate 2.
3. If Teammate 2 finds spec insufficient: relay to Teammate 1 for clarification. Max 2 coordination rounds per item (each round = Teammate 2 messages lead -> lead messages Teammate 1 -> Teammate 1 responds -> lead relays). If more than 2 rounds, escalate item to DEFERRED status and move on.

### Phase 4: Review and Close Loop

1. Run full test suite.
2. Update `plancasting/_progress.md` if it exists and features changed (new rows for new features, update Notes column for existing features with significant behavioral changes).
3. Generate `./feedback/resolution.md` with resolution table, summary statistics, spec version updates, and recommendations for next cycle.
4. **Archive processed feedback** -- copy (do not move) `input.md` to `./feedback/archive/`:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ./feedback/archive
   cp ./feedback/input.md ./feedback/archive/$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S)-input.md
   ```
5. Update `plancasting/tech-stack.md` if new dependencies were added.
6. Output summary.

## Gate Decision

- **PASS**: All APPROVED items resolved, tests pass, specs consistent, docs updated. Proceed to re-deployment (Stage 7) and re-verification (Stage 7V). Consider re-running Stage 6V if UI changes were made.
- **CONDITIONAL PASS**: Some items deferred due to complexity but all attempted items resolved. Document deferred items with `Status: DEFERRED -- Next batch [DATE]`. Schedule follow-up Stage 8 session.
- **FAIL**: Test suite fails, spec inconsistency detected, or APPROVED items left unresolved. Do NOT proceed to Stage 7 until PASS or CONDITIONAL PASS.

## Known Failure Patterns

1. **Conflicting feedback**: User A wants removal, User B wants expansion. Resolve by frequency, escalate to stakeholder, or document trade-off.
2. **Feature requests contradicting BRD**: ALWAYS check BRD business rules before accepting.
3. **Spec drift**: Cumulative changes make BRD/PRD inconsistent. Verify consistency after every change.
4. **Cross-cutting feedback**: "The app is slow" affects multiple features. Triage into specific, actionable items per feature.
5. **Architectural changes needed**: Defer to a separate Stage 5 re-run rather than patching.
6. **i18n key breakage**: ALWAYS update message files when changing user-facing text.

## Running This Prompt Repeatedly

Designed for regular cadence (weekly, biweekly, monthly). Each run processes a new batch, updates living docs, implements changes, archives feedback. Over time, `./feedback/archive/` builds a complete audit trail from user voice to product change.

## Cross-Stage References

- Dependency updates: defer to **Stage 9** (Dependency Maintenance) for safe, batched updates.
- UI changes: re-run **Stage 6V** (Visual & Functional Verification).
- After deploying: run **Stage 7V** (Production Smoke Verification).
- If performance feedback: use **Stage 6C** (Performance Optimization).
- User guide auto-deploys via GitHub on push if Mintlify GitHub App is configured.
- If user guide is fundamentally outdated, consider re-running **Stage 7D** instead of patching.
- Stage 8 runs in a continuous loop: collect feedback -> update specs -> implement fixes -> update docs -> deploy (Stage 7) -> verify (Stage 7V) -> collect more feedback -> repeat.

## Critical Rules

1. NEVER implement feedback contradicting a BRD business rule without spec-updater resolution first.
2. NEVER modify a spec without updating all cross-references.
3. ALWAYS defer architectural changes to a separate Stage 5 re-run.
4. ALWAYS run the full test suite after code changes.
5. ALWAYS update i18n message files when changing user-facing text.
6. For batches >15 items, split into multiple runs (max 15 APPROVED items per run, unless overridden in tech-stack.md).
7. After UI changes, recommend re-running Stage 6V.
8. After deploying, run Stage 7V.
9. NEVER skip the traceability chain -- every code change must trace to a spec.
10. Resolve conflicting feedback BEFORE implementing either side.
11. If deployment causes production failures, revert with `git revert` (not `git reset --hard`), re-run 7V, investigate before re-attempting.
12. NEVER run Stage 8 and Stage 9 concurrently. Complete one and commit before starting the other.
