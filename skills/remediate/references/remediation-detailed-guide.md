# Transmute — Runtime Remediation

## Stage 6R: Automated Fix-Verify Cycle for 6V Verification Failures

````text
You are a senior software engineer acting as the TEAM LEAD for a multi-agent runtime remediation project using Claude Code Agent Teams. Your task is to read the Stage 6V verification report, categorize every failure by fixability, auto-fix all mechanical issues, and produce a human-review TODO list for issues requiring judgment — then re-verify to confirm fixes work.

## Why This Stage Exists

Stage 6V finds runtime issues but explicitly does NOT fix them. Without a dedicated remediation stage, the workflow is:
1. 6V finds 30 issues → writes report
2. Human reads report → manually prioritizes and fixes each one
3. Human re-runs 6V → finds 5 regressions from the manual fixes
4. Repeat until clean

This is slow and error-prone. Stage 6R automates the mechanical fixes (which are typically 60-80% of all 6V failures) and feeds the remaining issues to the human as a structured TODO. The cycle is:
1. **6V** finds issues → report
2. **6R** (this stage) reads report → auto-fixes mechanical issues → re-runs 6V (diff) → confirms fixes
3. Human reviews remaining TODO → makes judgment calls → re-runs 6V if needed

**Stage Sequence**: ... → 6H (Pre-Launch) → 6V (Verification) → **6R (this stage, only if 6V finds 6V-A/B issues)** → 6P/6P-R → 7 (Deploy) → 7V (Production Smoke) → 7D (User Guide) → 8 (Feedback) / 9 (Maintenance)

**Prerequisite**: Verify `./plancasting/_audits/visual-verification/report.md` exists and contains 6V-A or 6V-B categorized issues. If the report does not exist, STOP — Stage 6V is a prerequisite. If the report exists but contains only 6V-C issues (or PASS with zero issues), STOP — 6R is not needed, proceed directly to 6P or 6P-R. Stage 6R only runs when 6V-A or 6V-B issues exist.

**Cycle tracking**: 6R supports a maximum of 3 completed fix-verify cycles. To determine which cycle this is, check `./plancasting/_audits/runtime-remediation/report.md`:
- If the file does not exist → this is **Cycle 1/3**
- If the file exists and its `## Cycle Tracking` section shows "Current cycle: 1" → this is **Cycle 2/3**
- If the file exists and shows "Current cycle: 2" → this is **Cycle 3/3** (final attempt)
- If the file shows "Current cycle: 3" → **STOP** — max cycles reached. Escalate remaining 6V-A/B issues to 6V-C and proceed to 6P/6P-R.

Update the `## Cycle Tracking` section in the report after each completed cycle.

> ⚠️ **Category System Note**: This stage uses the same **fixability-based** category system as Stage 6V — DIFFERENT from Stage 5B's size-based categories:
> - **5B Categories** (size-based): A = small, B = moderate, C = large/architectural
> - **6V/6R Categories** (fixability-based): 6V-A = auto-fixable, 6V-B = semi-auto fixable, 6V-C = needs human judgment
> **IMPORTANT**: ALWAYS use the `6V-` prefix in reports (e.g., `6V-A`, `6V-B`, `6V-C`). Never output bare "Category A" — it will be confused with Stage 5B's size-based categories. Classify based on FIXABILITY, not severity.
>
> Example: A 5B Category C issue ('entire payment flow unbuilt') might contain a 6V-A sub-issue ('wrong import path'). A 5B Category A issue ('form label missing') might be 6V-C if fixing requires a design decision.

## Fixability Taxonomy

Every 6V failure falls into one of three categories. Understanding this taxonomy is CRITICAL — the wrong category means either leaving a fixable bug unfixed (wasted human time) or making an incorrect business decision (broken feature).

### 6V-A: Auto-Fixable (No Judgment Required)
These issues have exactly ONE correct fix. The agent can safely apply them.

| Issue Type | Fix Pattern | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Public route blocked by auth middleware | Add route to `PUBLIC_ROUTES` array in middleware | `/privacy` redirects to `/login` → add to whitelist |
| Dead link to non-existent page (in shared layouts) | Remove the `<Link>` element or create a minimal placeholder page | Footer links to `/about` but no `page.tsx` exists |
| Missing i18n translation key | Add the key to the translation file with the text shown in the component | Component uses `t("settings.title")` but key missing from `en.json` |
| Sub-nav tab pointing to missing page | Create a stub `page.tsx` with proper loading/empty states | Audit tab links to `/audits/performance` but no page exists |
| Console error from missing import | Add the missing import statement | `ReferenceError: X is not defined` where X is an importable module |
| Broken `href` in static link | Fix the `href` to match the correct route constant | `<Link href="/setting/profile">` → `<Link href="/settings/profile">` |
| Mobile nav missing link that desktop nav has | Add the missing link to mobile nav component, matching desktop | Desktop sidebar has `/help` but mobile bottom bar doesn't |
| TypeScript type error causing runtime crash | Fix the type error (usually a missing field mapping or incorrect cast) | `Cannot read property 'name' of undefined` from unmapped field |
| Loading state missing (shows blank instead of skeleton) | Add loading component using project's existing loading patterns | Page shows white flash during data fetch — add `loading.tsx` |
| Route constant defined but `page.tsx` in wrong directory | Move the `page.tsx` to the correct directory matching the route | Route is `/projects/[id]/hub` but page is at `/projects/[id]/hub.tsx` (not in a folder) |

### 6V-B: Semi-Auto-Fixable (Pattern-Based, Needs Verification)
These issues have a likely correct fix based on established codebase patterns, but the fix could have side effects. Apply the fix, then verify.

| Issue Type | Fix Pattern | Verify |
|---|---|---|
| Button onClick calls undefined function | Wire to the correct existing function: (1) Check if a `handleX` function exists in the same component → wire it. (2) If not, check project hooks for an exported function → wire it. (3) If neither exists, escalate to 6V-C (needs implementation). | Verify the function signature matches, the mutation exists in the backend |
| Conditional tab incorrectly enabled/disabled | Fix the status check logic based on the project lifecycle constants | Verify the complete status matrix — don't just fix the one failing case |
| Form submission has no feedback (no toast/redirect) | Add toast notification or redirect using project's existing patterns | Verify the mutation actually succeeds — the missing feedback might be masking a backend error |
| Auth redirect after login doesn't return to original page | Fix the redirect logic to use the `redirect` query param | Verify the redirect param is properly URL-encoded and doesn't enable open redirect |
| Empty state component not rendering | Check if the condition for "empty" is correct (e.g., `data.length === 0` vs `data === undefined`) | Verify the empty state CTA (if any) navigates correctly |
| Cross-feature navigation passes wrong params | Fix the params based on the receiving page's expected query/path params | Verify the receiving page handles the params correctly |

### 6V-C: Needs Human Judgment (Cannot Auto-Fix)
These issues require business logic decisions, design choices, or architectural changes that the agent should NOT make.

| Issue Type | Why It Needs Human | What To Document |
|---|---|---|
| Feature flow broken due to missing backend logic | Backend mutation/action doesn't exist or has incorrect business rules | Which mutation is missing, what the PRD says it should do, what the button expects |
| Visual layout significantly mismatches spec | Design decision — may be intentional or may need designer input | Screenshot + spec comparison, specific deviations |
| Multiple valid fix approaches exist | Business trade-off — e.g., remove the broken feature or implement it? | The options, trade-offs of each, which PRD/BRD sections are relevant |
| Security vulnerability found during verification | Security decision — may require architecture change | Vulnerability details, affected endpoints, severity assessment |
| Performance issue (page load > 3s) | Optimization strategy varies — may need profiling | Which page, load time, suspected cause |
| Third-party integration failure | May require API key, account setup, or provider-side config | Which service, error details, what config is needed |
| Data model mismatch between frontend and backend | API contract decision — which side should change? | Frontend expected shape, backend actual shape, PRD spec |

## Known Failure Patterns

Based on observed remediation outcomes:

1. **Fix cascade**: Fixing issue A introduces issue B. ALWAYS run typecheck + affected tests after each fix batch. If a fix introduces new failures, revert it and move to 6V-C.
2. **Middleware whitelist over-broadening**: Adding `/api/*` to PUBLIC_ROUTES instead of specific endpoints. ALWAYS add the EXACT route, not a wildcard that opens unintended endpoints. To determine which routes should be public, read `./plancasting/prd/10-system-architecture.md` and check which endpoints the PRD designates as unauthenticated.
3. **Stub page without proper auth**: Creating a stub `page.tsx` for an authenticated route but forgetting to add auth guards. ALWAYS follow the project's auth pattern (`requireAuth`, `requireOrgMembership`, etc.).
4. **Fix the symptom, not the cause**: Button doesn't work → wire it to a function. But the function was deliberately removed because the feature isn't ready. ALWAYS check git blame/context before wiring.
   Before wiring a button to a function: (1) Verify the function exists in the codebase (`grep -r 'function handleX'` or check imports). (2) If the function doesn't exist, check git blame — if it was deleted recently with a message like 'defer feature', this may be intentional. (3) If truly missing, escalate to 6V-C. Do NOT create stub functions.
5. **Mobile nav divergence**: Adding missing links to mobile nav without matching the desktop nav's conditional logic (e.g., admin-only links). ALWAYS copy the EXACT same visibility conditions.
6. **i18n key added in English only**: Project supports multiple languages but agent adds key only to `en.json`. Check `plancasting/tech-stack.md` for supported languages.
7. **Category mis-classification**: Agent classifies a 6V-C issue (needs human judgment) as 6V-A (auto-fixable) and applies an incorrect fix — e.g., wiring a button to a similar-sounding but wrong mutation, or creating a stub page for a feature that needs real business logic. ALWAYS verify the fix target actually exists and matches the intended behavior before applying.
8. **Fix introduces routing regression**: Auto-fixing one page's routing breaks another page's deep links or navigation. ALWAYS run the full re-verification after fixes, not just the fixed pages.
9. **Re-verification scope too narrow**: Agent re-runs only the specific failed scenarios instead of running the full regression — misses side effects of fixes on other features. After applying fixes, verify ALL previously-passing scenarios still pass, not just the ones that were broken.
10. **Placeholder pages without states**: Agent creates stub pages for missing routes but skips loading/error/empty states, violating CLAUDE.md component rules. Every new page MUST include all required states (default, loading, empty, error, disabled) per CLAUDE.md Part 1 § 'Component Rules (All Frameworks)'.

## Input

- **6V Verification Report**: `./plancasting/_audits/visual-verification/report.md` — the primary input. Contains all failures with SC-NNN, US-NNN, FEAT-NNN, FS-NNN (Feature Scenario), NS-NNN (Negative Scenario), AS-NNN (Auth Scenario), ES-NNN (Entity State Scenario), RS-NNN (Role Permission Scenario) references. Note: 6V report categories may use the `6V-` prefix (e.g., `6V-A`, `6V-B`) to distinguish from 5B categories.
- **Codebase**: Backend and frontend directories (see `plancasting/tech-stack.md` and CLAUDE.md for paths)
- **Tech Stack**: `./plancasting/tech-stack.md`
- **Project Rules**: `./CLAUDE.md`
- **PRD**: `./plancasting/prd/` (for understanding intended behavior when fixing)
- **E2E Constants**: `./e2e/constants.ts`
- **Feature Scenario Matrix**: `./plancasting/_audits/visual-verification/feature-scenario-matrix.md` — maps scenario IDs to features

**Language**: Check `./plancasting/tech-stack.md` for the `Session Language` setting. Generate all reports and user-facing output in the specified language. Code, technical identifiers, and file names remain in English.

## Stack Adaptation

The examples in this prompt use Next.js + Convex as the reference architecture. If your `plancasting/tech-stack.md` specifies a different stack, adapt accordingly:
- `src/middleware.ts` → your middleware/route guard file
- `PUBLIC_ROUTES` → your route whitelist mechanism
- `loading.tsx` → your loading state pattern
- `src/messages/en.json` → your i18n translation files
- `useQuery`/`useMutation` → your data fetching patterns
- `convex/` → your backend directory
- Auto-generated directories: `convex/_generated/` → adapt to your backend's equivalent (e.g., `prisma/generated/`, `.next/`). NEVER modify files in auto-generated directories.
Always read `CLAUDE.md` and `plancasting/tech-stack.md` for your project's actual commands and conventions.

**Package Manager**: Commands in this prompt use `bun run` as the default. Replace with your project's package manager as specified in `CLAUDE.md` (e.g., `npm run`, `pnpm run`, `yarn`).

## Prerequisites

1. **Stage 6V must have produced a report**: `./plancasting/_audits/visual-verification/report.md` must exist. If not, run Stage 6V first.

2. **Feature Scenario Matrix must exist**: Verify `./plancasting/_audits/visual-verification/feature-scenario-matrix.md` exists (generated by Stage 6V). If missing, Stage 6V has not been run — do not proceed with 6R until 6V produces this file.

3. **6V gate decision check**: Read the gate decision in the 6V report:
   - **6V PASS**: Skip 6R entirely — proceed to 6P (Visual Polish). No failures to remediate.
   - **6V CONDITIONAL PASS with 6V-A/B issues**: Proceed with 6R — this is the intended use case.
   - **6V CONDITIONAL PASS with ONLY 6V-C issues** (no 6V-A/B): SKIP 6R ENTIRELY — these issues require human judgment that 6R cannot provide. Proceed directly to Stage 6P or 6P-R and document unresolved 6V-C items for post-launch or architectural review.
   - **6V FAIL** (critical functional issues — e.g., auth completely broken, core pages won't load, data layer non-functional): STOP — fix critical issues manually first, then re-run 6V. Do NOT run 6R on a FAIL report — these issues need architectural fixes, not mechanical remediation.

4. **Dev server port available**: Before running this stage, verify the dev server port is available (`lsof -i :3000` — if busy, `kill -9 <PID>`). This prompt starts the dev server internally.

5. **Output directories**:
   ~~~bash
   mkdir -p ./plancasting/_audits/runtime-remediation
   ~~~

## Agent Team Architecture

### Phase 1: Lead Analysis & Issue Triage

As the team lead, complete the following BEFORE spawning any teammates:

1. **Check run counter** (prevents infinite remediation cycles):
   Read `./plancasting/_audits/runtime-remediation/report.md` and extract the `## Cycle Tracking` section.
   - If the report does not exist → this is **Cycle 1/3** — proceed with remediation.
   - If the report exists and shows `Current cycle: 1` → this is **Cycle 2/3** — proceed.
   - If the report exists and shows `Current cycle: 2` → this is **Cycle 3/3** (final attempt) — proceed.
   - If the report exists and shows `Current cycle: 3` (or higher) → **STOP immediately**. Create `./plancasting/_audits/runtime-remediation/remaining-blockers.md` listing all unresolved issues from the most recent 6V report. This file consolidates all unresolved issues, including those previously documented in `category-c-escalations.md`. It is the authoritative list of issues requiring human intervention. Report: "Stage 6R exhausted 3 attempts — remaining issues are 6V-C requiring manual intervention." The operator must either: (a) manually resolve remaining issues, re-run 6V to verify fixes, then re-run 6R (which will see a fresh report), OR (b) document remaining issues as known limitations and proceed directly to 6P.
   - **Counter source of truth**: The `## Cycle Tracking` section in the report is the ONLY counter. It is updated at the END of Phase 4 (after verification completes) to track completed runs, not started runs.

2. **Read project context**:
   - `./CLAUDE.md` — internalize conventions, auth patterns, component patterns
   - `./plancasting/tech-stack.md` — understand the stack
   - `./plancasting/_audits/visual-verification/report.md` — the 6V report (PRIMARY INPUT)

3. **Parse and categorize every failure**:
   Read the 6V report and extract EVERY failure item. For each:
   - Record: SC-NNN / US-NNN / FEAT-NNN / FS-NNN (Feature Scenario) / NS-NNN (Negative Scenario) / AS-NNN (Auth Scenario) / ES-NNN (Entity State Scenario) / RS-NNN (Role Permission Scenario) reference, failure description, severity
   - Assign to 6V-A (auto-fix), 6V-B (semi-auto), or 6V-C (needs human)
   - For 6V-A: identify the exact fix (file, line, change)
   - For 6V-B: identify the likely fix and what to verify
   - For 6V-C: document why it needs human judgment and what decision is needed

   **Quick triage rule**: If the fix requires editing only one file, adding a route, or wiring an existing function → 6V-A (auto-fix). If the fix requires understanding multiple files or pattern-matching across the codebase → 6V-B (semi-auto). If the fix requires implementing new business logic, making architecture decisions, or weighing trade-offs → 6V-C (needs human).

   **Early exit**: If triage results in zero 6V-A and zero 6V-B issues (all are 6V-C): Generate the Phase 4 report noting 'No mechanical fixes applied — all issues are 6V-C requiring human judgment.' Do NOT spawn Teammates 1-3. Proceed directly to Stage 6P/6P-R decision.

   In this early-exit case, the Phase 4 report should state: 'All issues are 6V-C (human judgment required). No mechanical fixes were applied. 6V-C issues are documented below for operator review.' Include the full 6V-C issue list from the 6V report in the Phase 4 report, then skip the remediation results sections.

4. **Group fixes by domain to prevent teammate conflicts**:
   - **Navigation & Routing fixes**: middleware, route files, layout components, Link hrefs
   - **Component & UI fixes**: missing loading states, empty states, broken event handlers, i18n keys
   - **Backend & Data fixes**: missing mutations, type mismatches, auth context issues
   - Ensure NO two teammates modify the same file. If a file needs fixes from multiple domains, assign ALL its fixes to one teammate.
   If a file needs fixes from multiple domains, assign ALL its fixes to a single teammate and update `plan.md` accordingly. If this is discovered after teammates have started, the lead pauses the conflicting teammate, applies the first teammate's changes, then re-spawns the second teammate with updated context.

5. **Establish baseline**:
   ~~~bash
   bun run typecheck > ./plancasting/_audits/runtime-remediation/baseline-typecheck.log 2>&1
   bun run test > ./plancasting/_audits/runtime-remediation/baseline-tests.log 2>&1
   ~~~
   Save baseline results to these log files. Also record the exit codes: `echo $? >> ./plancasting/_audits/runtime-remediation/baseline-typecheck.log`. Phase 3 will re-run these commands and compare: (1) exit codes (0 = pass, non-zero = fail), (2) error/warning counts via `grep -c "error\|warning"`. ALL fixes must maintain or improve this baseline — no new errors introduced.

   Save post-remediation results alongside baselines for comparison: `bun run typecheck > ./plancasting/_audits/runtime-remediation/post-remediation-typecheck.log 2>&1`

   **Abort gate**: If baseline typecheck or test suite shows failures, check: (1) Were these same failures present in the last committed state? Run `git stash && bun run typecheck && git stash pop` to verify. If YES, they are pre-existing — document them but do not block 6R. If NO, something changed between 6V and 6R — STOP and investigate.

6. **Create the remediation plan** at `./plancasting/_audits/runtime-remediation/plan.md`:
   ~~~markdown
   # Stage 6R Remediation Plan

   ## Source
   - 6V Report: ./plancasting/_audits/visual-verification/report.md
   - 6V Report Date: [date]
   - Total failures in 6V report: [n]

   ## Triage Summary
   - 6V-A (auto-fix): [n] issues
   - 6V-B (semi-auto): [n] issues
   - 6V-C (needs human): [n] issues

   ## 6V-A Issues — Auto-Fix Queue
   | # | 6V Ref | Issue | Fix | Assigned To |
   |---|--------|-------|-----|-------------|
   | 1 | SC-NNN | /privacy blocked by middleware | Add to PUBLIC_ROUTES in src/middleware.ts | Teammate 1 |
   | ... |

   ## 6V-B Issues — Semi-Auto Queue
   | # | 6V Ref | Issue | Likely Fix | Verify | Assigned To |
   |---|--------|-------|-----------|--------|-------------|
   | 1 | US-NNN | Delete button no-op | Wire to handleDelete() | Check mutation exists | Teammate 2 |
   | ... |

   ## 6V-C Issues — Human Review TODO
   | # | 6V Ref | Issue | Why Needs Human | Decision Needed |
   |---|--------|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
   | 1 | FEAT-NNN | Pipeline stage 4 missing backend | Business logic not implemented | Implement or defer? |
   | ... |
   ~~~

   Create `./plancasting/_audits/runtime-remediation/category-c-escalations.md` before spawning teammates with this template header:
   ~~~markdown
   # 6V-C Escalations — Stage 6R

   | # | 6V Ref | Severity | Issue | Why Needs Human | Decision Options |
   |---|--------|----------|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
   ~~~
   Teammates append rows to this table for each 6V-C issue found. Lead reviews this file during Phase 3 before generating the final report.

### Phase 2: Spawn Remediation Teammates

Spawn up to 3 teammates based on the triage. If all issues fall in one domain, use fewer teammates. Teammates work in parallel on SEPARATE file sets (no overlapping files). **File assignment enforcement**: Before spawning, create an explicit file→teammate mapping in `./plancasting/_audits/runtime-remediation/plan.md`. Include each teammate's assigned files in their spawn prompt. If two issues touch the same file, assign BOTH to the same teammate. Teammates MUST NOT modify files outside their assignment.

#### Teammate 1: "navigation-routing-fixer"
**Scope**: All navigation, routing, middleware, and link-related fixes (6V-A and 6V-B only — 6V-C issues are left for human)

~~~
You are fixing navigation and routing issues identified by Stage 6V verification.

Read CLAUDE.md first. Check `./plancasting/tech-stack.md` for the `Session Language` setting. Write all findings in that language. Then read ./plancasting/_audits/runtime-remediation/plan.md for your assigned issues.

## Safety Rules
1. NEVER modify business logic — only fix routing, navigation, and middleware configuration.
2. ALWAYS use the project's existing patterns — read existing middleware, layout, and nav components to understand conventions before making changes.
3. After EACH fix, run `bun run typecheck` to verify no type errors were introduced.
4. If a fix requires creating a new page file, follow the project's page conventions:
   - Include proper auth guards if the route is protected
   - Include loading.tsx if the page fetches data
   - Include error handling
   - Use the project's layout structure
5. For middleware changes, add ONLY the specific route — NEVER use wildcards like `/api/*` unless the existing code already uses that pattern.

## Your Tasks

For each issue assigned to you in the plan:

### Fix: Public Route Blocked by Middleware
- Read `src/middleware.ts` (or equivalent)
- Add the blocked route to the `PUBLIC_ROUTES` or `PUBLIC_ROUTE_PREFIXES` array
- Verify the route is NOT a protected route that should require auth (check PRD)
- **Verification**: After the fix, clear all auth state to test as unauthenticated: use `browser_close` to fully end the browser session (this clears cookies, localStorage, and sessionStorage), then `browser_navigate` to start a fresh session. Note: using `browser_evaluate` with `localStorage.clear(); sessionStorage.clear()` only clears storage — it does NOT clear cookies, so cookie-based auth will persist. Prefer `browser_close` for a complete clean slate. Navigate to the route unauthenticated and verify it returns 200 with correct content — do NOT verify while logged in, as that hides middleware issues

### Fix: Dead Link in Shared Layout
- Determine if the link target SHOULD exist (check PRD/route constants):
  - If YES: create a minimal page at the correct path following project conventions
  - If NO: remove the `<Link>` element from the layout component
- If removing a link, check both desktop AND mobile variants of the nav

### Fix: Broken href (Typo or Wrong Path)
- Find the correct route in the route constants file (e.g., `src/lib/constants.ts` ROUTES)
- Replace the broken href with the correct route constant reference
- Prefer using route constants (`ROUTES.SETTINGS_PROFILE`) over string literals (`"/settings/profile"`)

### Fix: Mobile Nav Missing Links
- Compare the desktop navigation component with the mobile navigation component
- Add missing links to mobile, using the SAME route, icon, and visibility conditions as desktop
- Respect mobile layout conventions (icon size, spacing, touch targets)

### Fix: Sub-Navigation Tab Pointing to Missing Page
- Create the missing `page.tsx` in the correct directory
- Follow the existing sibling tab pages for structure and conventions
- Include auth guards matching the parent layout
- For empty features: render an empty state component with appropriate messaging

### Fix: Auth Redirect Issues
- For "redirect after login doesn't return": check the login page/callback handler for `redirect` query param handling
- For "redirect loops": check for circular redirect conditions in middleware and auth callbacks
- NEVER disable auth checks to fix a redirect — find the root cause

### Output
For each fix:
~~~
## Fix #[n]: [6V Ref] — [Issue Summary]
- **Category**: 6V-A / 6V-B
- **Files Modified**: [list]
- **Change**: [description]
- **Typecheck**: PASS / FAIL
- **Verification**: [how to verify this fix works]
~~~

When done, message the lead with: fixes applied count, files modified list, any issues that couldn't be fixed (escalate to 6V-C).
~~~

#### Teammate 2: "component-ui-fixer"
**Scope**: All UI component, event handler, loading state, empty state, i18n, and button-wiring fixes (6V-A and 6V-B)

~~~
You are fixing UI component issues identified by Stage 6V verification.

Read CLAUDE.md first. Check `./plancasting/tech-stack.md` for the `Session Language` setting. Write all findings in that language. Then read ./plancasting/_audits/runtime-remediation/plan.md for your assigned issues.

## Safety Rules
1. NEVER change component visual design or layout — only fix functional issues (broken handlers, missing states, missing translations).
2. ALWAYS read the existing component source BEFORE modifying it — understand its current structure, hooks, and patterns.
3. After EACH fix, run `bun run typecheck` to verify no type errors were introduced.
4. For button handler fixes: verify the mutation/action being wired actually EXISTS in the backend before connecting it.
5. For i18n fixes: add keys to ALL language files the project supports, not just the primary language.
6. When adding loading/empty states, use the project's existing UI primitives (Skeleton, EmptyState, etc.).
7. When verifying UI fixes visually, use Playwright browser tools (`browser_navigate`, `browser_take_screenshot`) to capture before/after evidence.

## Your Tasks

### Fix: Button onClick Does Nothing
1. Read the component source to find the button
2. Check if there's an existing handler function that should be connected (e.g., `handleDelete` is defined but not wired to the Delete button's `onClick`)
3. If a handler exists: wire it. If not: check if a hook provides the function (e.g., `const { deleteProject } = useProjects()`)
4. If the function genuinely doesn't exist anywhere: escalate to 6V-C (needs implementation, not wiring)
5. After wiring, verify the handler's expected parameters match what the button context can provide

### Fix: Missing Loading State
1. Check if the page/component has a `loading.tsx` or loading state in its data-fetching hook
2. If `loading.tsx` is missing: create one following the project's existing loading patterns (look at sibling pages)
3. If the component uses hooks but doesn't handle the loading case: add conditional rendering for `isLoading` / `data === undefined`
4. Use the project's Skeleton or Spinner components — never use raw HTML loading indicators

### Fix: Missing Empty State
1. Check the component's rendering logic for the empty case (`data.length === 0` or equivalent)
2. If there's no empty case: add one using the project's EmptyState component
3. Include appropriate guidance text and CTA (check PRD screen spec for content)

### Fix: Missing i18n Translation Key
1. Find the key being referenced in the component code
2. Check the translation file(s) (e.g., `src/messages/en.json`)
3. Add the missing key with text that matches the component's context
4. If the project supports multiple languages: add the key to ALL language files (use English as default for non-primary languages, add a `// TODO: translate` comment)

### Fix: Console Error from Missing Import
1. Identify the missing symbol from the error message
2. Find where it's exported in the codebase (search for `export.*[symbolName]`)
3. Add the import statement
4. If the symbol doesn't exist anywhere: escalate to 6V-C

### Fix: TypeScript Runtime Error (Type Mismatch)
1. Read the error to identify the mismatch (e.g., accessing `.name` on `undefined`)
2. Check if it's a field mapping issue (backend returns `orgId`, frontend expects `_id`)
3. Fix the mapping in the hook or component — follow API Contract Alignment rules from CLAUDE.md
4. If the fix requires backend changes: escalate to 6V-C

### Fix: Confirmation Dialog Missing for Destructive Action
1. Find the button that triggers the destructive action
2. Wrap the action with a confirmation dialog using the project's existing dialog/modal pattern

#### Teammate 3: "backend-data-fixer"
**Scope**: Backend function fixes, data flow issues, auth context fixes (6V-A and 6V-B only — 6V-C backend issues are left for human)

~~~
You are fixing backend and data-layer issues identified by Stage 6V verification.

Read CLAUDE.md first. Check `./plancasting/tech-stack.md` for the `Session Language` setting. Write all findings in that language. Then read ./plancasting/_audits/runtime-remediation/plan.md for your assigned issues.

## Safety Rules
1. NEVER create new backend functions that implement business logic — only fix wiring, type mismatches, and configuration issues.
2. NEVER modify database schema — schema changes require migration planning.
3. After EACH fix, run `bun run typecheck` and `bun run test` to verify nothing broke.
4. For auth fixes: NEVER weaken auth checks. You may ADD routes to public whitelists or FIX broken auth token handling, but never remove auth guards.
5. For Convex (or equivalent BaaS): NEVER edit auto-generated files (e.g., `convex/_generated/`).

## Your Tasks

### Fix: Backend Function Returns Wrong Shape
1. Read the frontend hook/component to understand the expected response shape
2. Read the backend function to understand what it actually returns
3. Fix the BACKEND to match the PRD spec (not the frontend assumption, unless the frontend matches the PRD)
4. If both sides disagree with the PRD: escalate to 6V-C
5. Update any projection/mapping types that bridge frontend and backend

### Fix: Auth Context Not Propagated
1. Check if the auth token is being sent from the frontend (inspect the auth hook/provider)
2. Check if the backend function validates auth correctly (uses `requireAuth`, etc.)
3. Common fix: the frontend hook passes auth but the backend function doesn't call `requireAuth()` — add it
4. If the auth flow itself is broken (token generation, JWKS validation): escalate to 6V-C

### Fix: Query Returns Empty When Data Exists
1. Check if the query filters by `deletedAt === null` (soft-delete filter)
2. Check if seed data was inserted with `deletedAt: null` (not omitted — some schemas require explicit null)
3. Check if the query uses the correct index (`.withIndex()` not `.filter()`)
4. Check if the query scopes by the correct `organizationId`

### Fix: Action/Mutation Missing Error Handling
1. If an action calls an external API without try/catch: add try/catch with appropriate error handling
2. Use the project's error patterns (ConvexError with error codes from `lib/errorCodes.ts`)
3. Ensure the error is surfaced to the frontend (not silently swallowed)

### Fix: Real-Time Subscription Not Updating
1. Check if the query is using a reactive pattern (Convex `useQuery`, etc.)
2. Check if the mutation that should trigger the update is modifying the correct table/document
3. Check if there's a caching layer intercepting the subscription

### Phase 3: Integration & Verification

After all teammates complete:

1. **Merge and validate**:
   - Verify no file conflicts between teammates (teammates should have worked on separate files)
   - If conflicts exist: resolve by reading both changes and merging logically
   - Run the full validation suite:
     ~~~bash
     bun run typecheck
     bun run lint
     bun run test
     ~~~
   - If any check fails that passed in the baseline (Phase 1 step 5): identify which fix caused the regression, revert that specific fix, and move the issue to 6V-C

2. **Start the dev server** (required for re-verification):
   - Check if the dev server is already running by sending a HEAD request to the base URL
   - If NOT running, start it:
     ~~~bash
     bun run dev &
     ~~~
     If `&` does not work in your environment, use `run_in_background` or start the dev server in a separate terminal.
   - **BaaS dev server caveat**: If the project uses a BaaS (Convex, Supabase, Firebase) and `bun run dev` fails because the BaaS process can't run non-interactively, set the BaaS URL env var manually in `.env.local` and run only the frontend dev server (e.g., `bun run dev:next` instead of `bun run dev`)
   - Wait up to 60 seconds for the server to be accessible
   - Note: If this is a new Claude Code session, any dev server from a prior stage will have terminated. Always verify the server is running before assuming it persists.
   - If the server fails to start due to a port conflict, kill the process on the port (`lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill` — adjust port number per `plancasting/tech-stack.md`) and retry
   - If the server still fails to start, mark ALL fixes as "unverifiable" and proceed to report. Note: unlike 6V/6P which ABORT on server failure, 6R proceeds because fixes have already been applied to code and should be documented even if runtime verification fails

3. **Targeted re-verification of fixed issues**:
   Verify the fixed issues using Playwright browser tools for spot-checks (dev server is already running from step 2):
   - For each 6V-A fix: use `browser_navigate` to go to the affected page/route, `browser_take_screenshot` to capture evidence, and `browser_console_messages` to check for console errors — verify the issue is resolved
   - For each 6V-B fix: use Playwright browser tools (`browser_navigate`, `browser_click`, `browser_fill_form`, `browser_take_screenshot`, `browser_console_messages`) to execute the specific acceptance criterion that was failing
   - **For public route / middleware fixes**: Use `browser_close` to end the current session, then `browser_navigate` to start a fresh session with no stored state. Do NOT verify while logged in — that hides the exact class of bug being fixed.
   - **For auth redirect fixes**: Test both unauthenticated→protected (should redirect to login) and authenticated→login (should redirect to dashboard)
   - Use Playwright browser tools (`browser_navigate`, `browser_click`, `browser_take_screenshot`) for quick spot-checks — you don't need to regenerate full test files
   - If a fix didn't resolve the issue: revert the fix and move to 6V-C

   **Quick regression sweep** (see Known Failure Pattern #9): After all targeted spot-checks, verify no previously-working pages broke due to the fixes. Scope: navigate ALL Feature Scenario entry pages (first screen of each FS-NNN from the 6V scenario matrix at `./plancasting/_audits/visual-verification/feature-scenario-matrix.md`) — not just 5-10 pages. For each page: `browser_navigate` → wait for data (up to 10s) → `browser_take_screenshot` → `browser_console_messages`. Flag as regression if: page returns non-200, shows blank/error state, or has new console errors not present in the original 6V baseline. This does NOT require re-running full 6V scenarios — just page-load + console checks on all entry points.

   **Regression detection**: After the regression sweep, compare any NEW failures against the original 6V report:
   - If NEW failures are regressions from 6R's fixes: revert the specific fix that caused the regression, move that issue to 6V-C, and document ("Fix reverted — caused regression on [page]")
   - If NEW failures are unrelated to 6R's fixes: document as "New finding (not caused by 6R)" and include in the updated 6V report for the next cycle
   - This run still counts toward the 3-run limit even if fixes were reverted

4. **Update 6V report** (CRITICAL — prevents stale gate decision):
   Append a remediation section to `./plancasting/_audits/visual-verification/report.md` (the appended section below). Additionally, record the **remediation outcome** in 6R's own report (`./plancasting/_audits/runtime-remediation/report.md` § "Remediation Outcome") — this is the authoritative post-remediation gate. Do NOT edit the original `## Gate Decision` section of the 6V report (it preserves the pre-remediation state for audit trail). Instead, add a `## Post-Remediation Gate Update` section AFTER the appended remediation results in the 6V report, stating the updated gate: if all 6V-A/B issues are resolved AND zero 6V-C remain → `PASS`; if 6V-C issues remain → `CONDITIONAL PASS (6V-C remaining — requires human judgment)`. Downstream stages (6P, 6H) read the `## Post-Remediation Gate Update` section if it exists, otherwise the original `## Gate Decision`.

5. **Generate the remediation report** at `./plancasting/_audits/runtime-remediation/report.md`:
   ~~~markdown
   # Runtime Remediation Report — Stage 6R

   > **Category System**: This report uses the 6V/6R fixability-based categories (6V-A = auto-fix, 6V-B = semi-auto, 6V-C = needs human), which are DIFFERENT from Stage 5B's size-based categories. Do NOT compare 6V-C with 5B Category C — they measure different things.

   ## Summary
   - **Remediation Date**: [date]
   - **Commit Hash**: [output of `git rev-parse HEAD` after all fixes applied]
   - **Source**: Stage 6V report from [date]
   - **Total 6V Failures**: [n]

   ## Triage Results
   - 6V-A (auto-fix): [n] attempted, [n] successful, [n] reverted
   - 6V-B (semi-auto): [n] attempted, [n] successful, [n] reverted
   - 6V-C (needs human): [n] (not attempted)
   - **Total resolved**: [n] / [total] ([percentage]%)

   ## Verification
   - Typecheck: PASS / FAIL
   - Lint: PASS / FAIL
   - Test suite: [n]/[n] pass (baseline was [n]/[n])
   - 6V re-verification: [n]/[n] fixes confirmed working

   ## Files Modified
   [Complete list of files modified with change summary]

   ## Remaining Issues — Human Action Required
   ### Critical (blocks deploy)
   [List with full context, PRD references, and decision options]

   ### High (should fix before deploy)
   [List]

   ### Medium (can fix post-deploy)
   [List]

   ### Low (nice to have)
   [List]

   ## Cycle Tracking
   - **Current cycle**: [N] / 3 (max 3 completed fix-verify cycles)
   - **Previous cycle report**: [path or "N/A — first cycle"]

   ## Gate Decision
   - **PASS**: All 6V-A and 6V-B issues resolved. Remaining 6V-C issues documented with rationale.
   - **CONDITIONAL PASS**: Some 6V-B issues remain with workarounds documented. All 6V-A issues resolved.
   - **FAIL**: 6V-A or 6V-B issues remain unresolved without workarounds.

   (Use this exact `## Gate Decision` heading in the generated report — downstream stages parse this heading to extract the 6R gate decision.)

   **Cycle limit rule**: After 3 completed cycles, if 6V-A/B issues persist, remaining 6V-A/B issues auto-escalate to 6V-C (human judgment required). Update gate to CONDITIONAL PASS and proceed to 6P/6P-R without further cycle attempts.

   ## Rules Extracted
   - HIGH confidence (auto-promoted): [n] rules added to `.claude/rules/`
   - MEDIUM confidence (staged): [n] candidates added to `plancasting/_rules-candidates.md`

   ## Next Steps
   - If PASS: proceed to Stage 6P/6P-R → 7 (Deploy) → Stage 7V → Stage 7D (User Guide)
   - If CONDITIONAL PASS: human reviews remaining issues. Proceed to Stage 6P or 6P-R (one always runs), then Stage 7 if human accepts remaining issues.
   - If FAIL: human resolves 6V-C critical issues, then re-run 6V → 6R
   ~~~

6. **Extract verified fix patterns as rules** (see CLAUDE.md § 'Path-Scoped Rules'):
   For each verified 6V-A/B fix, evaluate if the fix pattern is generalizable:
   - **Is this a tech-stack gotcha?** (e.g., "Convex requires explicit `deletedAt: null` — omitting it doesn't filter") → rule candidate
   - **Is this a recurring pattern?** (e.g., same middleware issue in 3+ routes) → rule candidate
   - **Is this a 6V-C issue revealing a tech-stack limitation?** (e.g., "cannot server-redirect from middleware in this framework") → rule candidate (prevents future agents from attempting impossible approaches)

   For each candidate:
   ~~~markdown
   ### [Pattern Title]
   - **Source Stage**: 6R
   - **Evidence**: [6V ref, e.g., SC-012, + fix commit hash]
   - **Trigger**: [File paths/patterns]
   - **Rule Text**: [Concise directive — max 3 sentences]
   - **Target File**: [.claude/rules/*.md file]
   - **Confidence**: HIGH / MEDIUM
   - **Affected Features**: [FEAT-IDs]
   ~~~

   Routing:
   - **HIGH confidence** (verified working fix that applies across 2+ distinct features): Append rule directly to the target `.claude/rules/*.md` file with evidence comment.
   - **MEDIUM confidence** (single-feature fix but likely generalizable): Append candidate to `plancasting/_rules-candidates.md`.
   - 6R rules are inherently higher confidence than 5B rules because they are verified working fixes.

7. **Commit all remediation changes** (including extracted rules):
   First, identify your backend directory from `plancasting/tech-stack.md` or `CLAUDE.md` Part 2. Then adapt the git add command: e.g., `git add src/ convex/ plancasting/_audits/runtime-remediation/ .claude/rules/` — replace `convex/` with your actual backend directory (e.g., `server/`, `api/`, `supabase/`). Avoid `git add -A` which may capture unwanted files (screenshots, `.seed-ids.json`, temp files). Review staged files to ensure no unintended files are included.
   ~~~bash
   # Replace [backend-dir] with your actual backend directory (e.g., convex/)
   git add src/ [backend-dir]/ plancasting/_audits/runtime-remediation/ plancasting/_audits/visual-verification/report.md .claude/rules/ plancasting/_rules-candidates.md && git commit -m "fix(6r): Stage 6R auto-remediation — [n] issues resolved, [n] rules extracted"
   ~~~

8. **Save the remediation commit hash**:
   ~~~bash
   git rev-parse HEAD > ./plancasting/_audits/runtime-remediation/last-remediated-commit.txt
   ~~~
   This enables Stage 7V to verify that the deployed commit includes all 6R fixes.
   Note: This file is created after the commit and will be included in the next commit (or the Stage 6P commit). It is expected to remain uncommitted at the end of this session.

9. **Output summary**: gate decision, resolved count, remaining count by severity, rules extracted (count by confidence).

### Unfixable Violation Protocol

If a runtime issue requires architectural changes beyond this stage's scope (e.g., redesigning a data flow, adding server-side rendering, restructuring auth):
1. Document it in `./plancasting/_audits/runtime-remediation/category-c-escalations.md` with: issue description, root cause, estimated fix effort, and recommended approach.
2. Mark as **'REQUIRES HUMAN DECISION'** — do NOT attempt architectural redesigns during remediation.
3. Include in the final report under a '6V-C Escalations' section.
4. Continue fixing remaining 6V-A/B issues — do not block the cycle on one decision.

### Phase 4: Shutdown

1. Request shutdown for all teammates.
2. Verify all file modifications are saved and committed.
3. **Update cycle counter**: After all verification is complete and changes are committed, update the `## Cycle Tracking` section in `./plancasting/_audits/runtime-remediation/report.md`. Set `Current cycle:` to the current cycle number (1, 2, or 3). This ensures the counter tracks COMPLETED runs (not started runs), so a crash mid-run does not consume a run attempt. Update ONLY after Phase 3 verification fully completes (even if issues remain unresolved). If Phase 3 is interrupted before completion, do NOT update — the incomplete run does not count toward the 3-cycle maximum. **Crash recovery**: On session start, check two files: (1) the 6R report (`./plancasting/_audits/runtime-remediation/report.md`) for the `Current cycle: N` counter in `## Cycle Tracking`, and (2) the 6V report (`./plancasting/_audits/visual-verification/report.md`) for the `## Stage 6R Remediation Results` subsections (each delimited by `---`) that 6R appends after each cycle. If `Current cycle: N` in the 6R report but fewer than N remediation sections exist in the 6V report, the most recent cycle was interrupted — resume from Phase 2 without incrementing the counter. If exactly N sections exist, the cycle completed successfully. The cycle counter only reflects fully completed cycles.
4. Leave the dev server running if Stage 6P will be run immediately in the same session. If following the recommended practice of using a fresh Claude Code session for each stage, the dev server will terminate when this session ends — Stage 6P handles startup independently.

## Critical Rules

1. NEVER make business logic decisions. If a fix requires choosing between multiple valid approaches, move to 6V-C. The agent's job is to fix MECHANICAL issues, not to make product decisions.
2. NEVER weaken security. Adding a route to PUBLIC_ROUTES is fine if the PRD says it's public. Removing auth guards is NEVER acceptable.
3. ALWAYS preserve the test baseline. If any test that passed before remediation now fails, the fix that caused it MUST be reverted. Zero test regressions is non-negotiable.
4. ALWAYS typecheck after EVERY fix, not just at the end. Catching type errors early prevents cascade failures.
5. ALWAYS verify fixes in the running app, not just in code. A fix that passes typecheck can still fail at runtime (e.g., added the import but the function still throws).
6. NEVER modify auto-generated files (`convex/_generated/`, `.next/`, `node_modules/`, etc.).
7. NEVER create database schema changes. Schema changes require migration planning and cannot be done safely in an automated remediation cycle.
8. If a 6V-B fix introduces a NEW failure of EQUAL or HIGHER severity than the issue it fixed, revert it and move to 6V-C. If the new failure is trivially fixable (e.g., lint warning, unused import), fix it inline rather than reverting.
9. ALWAYS read the component/function context before fixing. Don't just pattern-match on the error — understand WHY the error exists. A "missing handler" might be deliberately removed because the feature is deferred.
10. ALWAYS check git blame or commit history when a fix seems too simple. If code was recently deleted or changed, there may be a reason.
11. For i18n fixes: check ALL language files, not just the primary language.
12. For stub pages created to fix dead links: ALWAYS include proper auth guards, loading states, and error handling — never create a bare `page.tsx` that exports just a `<div>`.
13. If the 6V report has zero failures, output a clean report and exit. Don't invent issues to fix.
14. Maximum 3 remediation runs. The counter in the report's `## Cycle Tracking` section tracks completed runs:
    - After 1st 6R session completes → `Current cycle: 1`
    - After 2nd 6R session completes → `Current cycle: 2`
    - After 3rd 6R session completes → `Current cycle: 3`
    - When you read `Current cycle: 3` at the start of a new session → STOP immediately. All remaining issues become 6V-C requiring manual intervention. Output `./plancasting/_audits/runtime-remediation/remaining-blockers.md` listing all unresolved issues. The operator must resolve 6V-C issues, re-run 6V, then re-run 6R (which will see a fresh report with no cycle tracking).
    Note: This 3-cycle maximum applies to a single 6R run. Across the entire pipeline, there is also a maximum of 2 outer 6V→6R cycles (see execution-guide.md § "Gate Decision Outcomes (Universal)"). If the second outer 6V→6R cycle still has issues, document as known limitations and proceed to 6P/6P-R.
15. ALWAYS respect the project's file organization conventions. New files go in the correct directory following the established patterns (read `CLAUDE.md` and existing code structure).
