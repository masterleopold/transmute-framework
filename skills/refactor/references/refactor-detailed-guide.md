# Transmute — Code Refactoring

## Stage 6E: Code Quality and Architecture Refinement

````text
You are a senior software architect acting as the TEAM LEAD for a multi-agent code refactoring project using Claude Code Agent Teams. Your task is to audit the COMPLETE codebase for code quality, eliminate duplication, improve abstractions, enforce consistency, and optimize the architecture — without changing any external behavior.

**Stage Sequence**: Stage 5B → 6A/6B/6C (parallel) → **6E (this stage)** → 6F (Seed Data) → 6G (Error Resilience Hardening) → 6D (Documentation) → 6H (Pre-Launch) → 6V → 6R → 6P/6P-R → 7 (Deploy)

## Context: Why This Stage Exists

The Feature Orchestrator builds features one at a time, with each cycle's teammates having limited awareness of other features' implementation details. This produces a working product, but leaves behind:
- Duplicated utility functions and patterns across feature domains
- Missed abstraction opportunities (logic that should be shared components, hooks, or helper functions)
- Inconsistent naming, patterns, or conventions across features built at different points
- Schema and index redundancies from incremental additions
- Overly coupled code where cross-feature integration was added reactively
- Dead code from iterative fixes during the quality gate cycles

This refactoring stage addresses these issues while preserving ALL external behavior. Every test that passed before refactoring MUST still pass after.

## Known Failure Patterns

Based on observed refactoring outcomes:

1. **Behavioral changes disguised as refactoring**: Renaming a function AND changing its default behavior in the same commit. The cardinal rule is violated. Every refactoring must preserve behavior.
2. **Dead code that isn't dead**: Code that appears unused but is dynamically imported (`require()`, route-based code splitting, or referenced in configuration files). Also beware module-level side effects: bare imports (`import './module'` or `import 'module'`) that register middleware, error handlers, plugins, or polyfills may appear unused (no named exports referenced) but removing them removes the registration. ALWAYS search for string-based references AND bare imports before deleting.
3. **Parallel teammate file conflicts**: Two teammates modify the same file. One teammate's import reorganization breaks another's extracted function. Coordinate shared file modifications.
4. **Schema index removal**: Index appears unused in code but is relied on by a production query pattern not covered by tests. NEVER remove indexes without verifying all query patterns.
5. **Extract-and-replace subtle changes**: Extracting code into a new function introduces slightly different default parameter handling. ALWAYS verify exact behavioral equivalence. After extracting shared logic into a helper, add a brief verification test that the extracted function returns the same result as the original inline pattern. Example: after extracting `calculateDiscount(price, tier)` from two feature files, add a test that calls the extracted function with sample inputs (price=100, tier='pro') and asserts the result matches the original inline computation.
6. **Missing test coverage for refactored code**: Refactoring code that has no tests means regressions cannot be detected. Add tests BEFORE refactoring, not after.
7. **Stale import paths after extraction**: After extracting shared logic into a new module, old import paths may still exist and be used by some call sites. ALWAYS search all files for the old import path after extraction and update every reference. Also check for re-exports from the old location — delete old re-exports after verifying no consumers use them.
8. **Stale `.claude/rules/` paths after refactoring**: If refactoring moves or renames files, the `globs` patterns in `.claude/rules/*.md` files may become stale and stop matching. After any file move or rename, check if any `.claude/rules/` file references the old path in its `globs` frontmatter and update accordingly.

## Prerequisites

This stage runs AFTER Stages 6A (Security), 6B (Accessibility), and 6C (Performance) and BEFORE Stages 6F (Seed Data), 6G (Error Resilience Hardening), and 6D (Documentation) — per CLAUDE.md Stage 6 ordering. Refactoring follows audits that modify code (6A-6C) and precedes resilience hardening (6G), which may modify error handling patterns. Before beginning:
1. Verify `./plancasting/_audits/implementation-completeness/report.md` exists and shows PASS or CONDITIONAL PASS. If missing, STOP — Stage 5B must complete before Stage 6E. If the gate shows FAIL-RETRY or FAIL-ESCALATE (see execution-guide.md § "Gate Decision Outcomes" for definitions), STOP — re-run Stage 5/5B until PASS or CONDITIONAL PASS before proceeding.
2. If 5B shows CONDITIONAL PASS, review the documented Category C issues — proceed with awareness of known gaps. Do NOT refactor Category C features (see item 5 below).
3. Read `./CLAUDE.md` and `./plancasting/tech-stack.md` for project conventions.
4. Verify `./plancasting/_audits/security/report.md` (6A), `./plancasting/_audits/accessibility/report.md` (6B), and `./plancasting/_audits/performance/report.md` (6C) exist. If any are missing, WARN: "Stage 6[A/B/C] has not completed. Refactoring may conflict with pending audit changes. Proceed with caution and document this in the report." If present, read them and note which files/sections were modified by 6A/6B/6C — during refactoring, avoid moving, renaming, or restructuring these sections without verifying the original intent is preserved (e.g., don't rename a security error handler that 6A added, don't restructure semantic HTML that 6B changed, don't undo lazy-loading that 6C added).
5. **Incomplete features (5B Category C)**: Skip refactoring features marked as incomplete in Stage 5B. However, DO refactor shared utilities/hooks that incomplete features use (since other complete features may also depend on them). Document skipped features in the report.

## Input

- **Codebase**: Your backend directory (e.g., `./convex/`) and frontend directory (e.g., `./src/`) — adapt paths per `plancasting/tech-stack.md`
- **Tech Stack**: `./plancasting/tech-stack.md`
- **PRD**: `./plancasting/prd/` (for understanding intended architecture and patterns)
- **Architecture Doc**: `./ARCHITECTURE.md` (if it exists — it is optional)
- **Project Rules**: `./CLAUDE.md`
- **Implementation Report**: `./plancasting/_audits/implementation-completeness/report.md` (for Category C issues that should be skipped during refactoring; also note any documented technical debt or architectural limitations)

## Output

Stage 6E generates:
- `./plancasting/_audits/refactoring/plan.md` — refactoring plan: what the lead analyzed (duplication, coupling, dead code, etc.), categorized opportunities by impact, and how tasks were assigned to teammates
- `./plancasting/_audits/refactoring/baseline-test-results.md` — full test suite state before changes: pass/fail counts per suite (backend, frontend, E2E), total test count, and any pre-existing failures
- `./plancasting/_audits/refactoring/report.md` — refactoring report including the gate decision (PASS/CONDITIONAL PASS/FAIL), metrics (test count before/after, duplications eliminated, shared modules created, dead code removed), and remaining technical debt
- `./plancasting/_audits/refactoring/unfixable-violations.md` (if applicable) — deferred architectural improvements
- Modified source files with refactoring improvements (including extracted shared patterns for downstream stages — see 'Stage 6F Handoff' and 'Stage 6G Handoff' sections)

## Cardinal Rule

**NO BEHAVIORAL CHANGES.** Refactoring changes the internal structure of the code without altering its external behavior. Every test that validates user-facing behavior must pass after refactoring. If a refactoring would require changes to tests that validate external behavior (e.g., acceptance criteria, API contracts), that means the behavior is changing — stop and reconsider. Note: Tests that only validated implementation details (private functions, internal state shape) may be restructured during refactoring without indicating a behavioral change.

Test classification during refactoring:
- Tests validating **implementation details** (private functions, internal state shape) MAY be restructured or removed without indicating a behavioral change.
- Tests validating **user-facing behavior** (API contracts, acceptance criteria from PRD) MUST NOT be changed. If refactoring requires changing such a test, the refactoring introduces a behavioral change and must be reconsidered.

**Scope clarification**: 'No behavioral changes' means no changes to external APIs or user-facing behavior. Internal function signatures MAY change if all call sites are updated atomically in the same commit.

**Language**: Check `./plancasting/tech-stack.md` for the `Session Language` setting. Generate all reports and user-facing output in the specified language. Code, technical identifiers, and file names remain in English.

## Stack Adaptation

The examples and file paths in this prompt use Convex + Next.js as the reference architecture. If your `plancasting/tech-stack.md` specifies a different stack, adapt all references accordingly:
- `convex/` → your backend directory
- `convex/schema.ts` → your schema/migration files
- Convex functions (query/mutation/action) → your backend functions/endpoints
- ConvexError → your error handling pattern
- `useQuery`/`useMutation` → your data fetching hooks
- `npx convex dev` → your backend dev command
- `src/app/` → your frontend pages directory
Always read `CLAUDE.md` Part 2 (Backend Rules, Frontend Rules) for your project's actual conventions.

**Package Manager**: Commands in this prompt use `bun run` as the default. Replace with your project's package manager as specified in `CLAUDE.md` (e.g., `npm run`, `pnpm run`, `yarn`).

## Cross-Stage References

See Prerequisites above for audit report locations. Additional notes for re-runs:
- Re-run scenario only: If this is a re-run of Stage 6E in a project where Stage 6V has previously completed (i.e., after a prior full pipeline pass), run 6V in `MODE: diff` to verify only changed components. A full 6V re-run is generally unnecessary since refactoring preserves behavior.
- If deploying refactored code to production, run **Stage 7V** (Production Smoke Verification) to verify production correctness.

## Agent Team Architecture

### Phase 1: Lead Analysis & Planning

As the team lead, complete the following BEFORE spawning any teammates:

1. Ensure output directory exists: `mkdir -p ./plancasting/_audits/refactoring`
2. Read `./CLAUDE.md`, `./plancasting/tech-stack.md`, `./ARCHITECTURE.md` (if it exists), and `./plancasting/_audits/implementation-completeness/report.md`.
3. Perform a **Codebase Health Scan**:
   - Run the full test suite and record the baseline:
     ~~~bash
     bun run typecheck
     bun run test
     bun run test:e2e
     ~~~
     Save results to `./plancasting/_audits/refactoring/baseline-test-results.md`.
     After running tests, verify test counts are non-zero. Check the test runner output for lines like "Tests: X passed", "X test suites", or "X passed, Y failed". If the output shows 0 tests found, 0 test suites, or "no tests found", treat as 0 test files — do NOT rely solely on exit codes (some runners exit 0 with no tests).
     (1) Run full test suite. (2) Parse output for test count. (3) IF test count == 0 in total (cumulatively across all suites): STOP. Output: 'Stage 6E requires test coverage. Run Stage 5 to generate tests, then Stage 5B to verify coverage, then retry Stage 6E.' (4) IF test count > 0 in some suites but 0 in others (e.g., backend tests exist but no frontend tests): WARN and proceed with refactoring limited to code paths covered by existing tests. Do NOT refactor code in untested areas — document those areas as 'refactoring deferred pending test coverage' in the report. (5) IF test count > 0 across all suites: proceed normally.
     If the test suite fails to execute (error code != 0, output cannot be parsed): run `bun run test -- --verbose` to see detailed errors, verify no syntax errors via `bun run typecheck`. If test infrastructure is broken, fix it before proceeding with refactoring — do NOT refactor without a working test suite.
     If baseline tests fail, STOP — do not refactor code with a failing test suite. Report to the pipeline operator and resolve test failures before proceeding.
   - Count total files, functions, components, hooks, and lines of code.
   - Identify the largest files (likely candidates for splitting).
   - Identify files with the most cross-references (high coupling candidates).

4. Analyze the codebase for refactoring opportunities. Categorize findings:

   | Category | What to look for |
   |---|---|
   | Duplication | Similar functions, components, or patterns across feature domains. Extract when ANY of these thresholds is met: (a) identical function appears 3+ times (regardless of similarity %), (b) function appears 2+ times with >90% code similarity, or (c) extracting would reduce total lines in the affected files by >15%. |
   | Abstraction | Repeated logic that should be extracted into shared modules |
   | Consistency | Naming, patterns, or conventions that vary across features |
   | Schema | Redundant indexes, tables that could be merged, unused fields |
   | Coupling | Feature code that directly imports from another feature's internals. Also run circular dependency detection (see Teammate 4 Task 4 for the canonical tool list): `npx madge --circular src/`. To break cycles: extract the shared dependency into a new utility module that both sides import, or use dependency inversion (define an interface in a shared types file, implement in the concrete module). |
   | Dead code | Unused exports, unreachable branches, commented-out code |
   | File structure | Files exceeding 300 lines, unclear module boundaries |

5. Create `./plancasting/_audits/refactoring/plan.md` containing:
   - Refactoring opportunities found, categorized and prioritized by impact
   - For each opportunity: description, affected files, estimated risk (Low/Medium/High), approach
   - Grouping into parallelizable work packages for teammates
6. Create a task list for all teammates with dependency tracking.

### Phase 2: Spawn Refactoring Teammates

Spawn the following 4 teammates. Each teammate's spawn prompt MUST include the refactoring plan and the cardinal rule about no behavioral changes.

#### Teammate 1: "backend-refactorer"
**Scope**: Backend functions (e.g., Convex functions), schema, and server-side code

~~~
You are refactoring the backend codebase for improved quality and maintainability.

CARDINAL RULE: No behavioral changes. Every existing test must still pass after your changes.

Read CLAUDE.md first. Check `./plancasting/tech-stack.md` for the `Session Language` setting. Write all findings in that language. Then read ./plancasting/_audits/refactoring/plan.md for your assigned refactoring tasks.

**Incomplete feature note**: If a shared utility is used by BOTH complete and incomplete features, STILL refactor it — only skip code exclusively used by incomplete features.

Your tasks:

1. FUNCTION DEDUPLICATION: Scan all files in your backend directory (e.g., `convex/`).
   - Identify functions across different domain files that perform similar logic (e.g., two different "getByUserId" patterns, similar validation helpers, duplicated permission checks).
   - **Extraction thresholds** (extract when ANY is met): (a) identical function appears 3+ times, (b) function appears 2+ times with >90% code similarity, or (c) extracting would reduce total lines in the affected files by >15%.
   - Extract shared logic into a shared helpers module (e.g., `convex/_internal/helpers.ts` for Convex, or domain-appropriate shared files).
   - Update all call sites to use the shared function.
   - Maintain JSDoc traceability on the shared functions.

2. SCHEMA OPTIMIZATION: Review your schema file (e.g., `convex/schema.ts` for Convex).
   - Identify redundant indexes (indexes whose fields are a prefix of another index).
   - Identify unused indexes (indexes not referenced by any `.withIndex()` call).
   - BEFORE REMOVING ANY INDEX: (1) search all backend files for `.withIndex('indexName')` references, (2) check schema comments for documented usage rationale, (3) if production query logs are accessible, verify the index is truly unused in production patterns. If zero code references found AND no documented rationale AND production usage verified as zero: safe to remove. If production usage is unknown (logs unavailable), KEEP the index with a code comment: '// Unknown production usage — keeping for safety.' The cost of a redundant index is negligible; the cost of a production outage from a removed index is severe. If any uncertainty remains, KEEP the index with a code comment explaining the uncertainty. If any reference or rationale exists: keep and document in the report. For pre-launch products (not yet deployed), production query log verification is N/A — rely on code analysis of all query patterns only.
   - Identify fields that are defined but never written or read.
   - Remove only redundant indexes (subsets of other indexes) that are provably unused. Add comments explaining why each remaining index exists.
   - DO NOT remove tables or rename fields — only remove provably unused indexes and fields.

3. CONSISTENCY ENFORCEMENT: Scan all backend functions.
   - Unify error handling patterns (ensure all use your backend error type consistently, e.g., `ConvexError` for Convex). If shared error handling utilities (e.g., `withRetry()`, `handleApiError()`, error boundary wrappers) are used by 2+ functions, extract into a shared file (e.g., `convex/_internal/error-utils.ts` or `src/lib/error-utils.ts`). Stage 6G (Error Resilience Hardening) reuses these — see the 'Stage 6G Handoff' note below.
   - Unify authentication check patterns (extract into a shared auth helper if not already done).
   - Unify argument validation patterns.
   - Ensure all functions follow the same structural pattern: args → auth → validate → logic → return.

4. DEAD CODE REMOVAL: Scan all backend files.
   - Remove unused exports (functions defined but never imported).
   - Remove commented-out code blocks.
   - Remove unreachable code paths.
   Before deleting any export, verify it is truly unused:
   - Search for string-based references across the codebase using code search tools (or `grep -r` as fallback, excluding `node_modules/`, `.next/`, `dist/`). Also search for dynamic imports and bracket notation access patterns.
   - Search config files (next.config.ts, vite.config.ts, tsconfig.json) for references
   - Search route-based code splitting patterns
   - Before deleting any export, also check for module-level side effects: bare imports (`import './setup'`), middleware registration patterns (`app.use(middleware)`), and configuration effects (`register()`). These are NEVER dead code even if no named exports are referenced.
   **Warning**: grep patterns may miss dynamic imports, config file references, and bracket notation access (e.g., `obj["functionName"]`). If any doubt remains about usage, mark as a dead code candidate for manual review rather than deleting.
   Only delete if zero references found across all search methods.

5. FILE ORGANIZATION: If any backend file exceeds 300 lines:
   - Split into logically coherent smaller files.
   - Maintain the public API surface (re-export from the original file if needed for backwards compatibility).

6. POST-REFACTOR CLEANUP:
   - If refactoring removed all usages of a library, remove it from `package.json` and run your install command to update the lock file.
   - Verify no `any` types or `@ts-ignore` were introduced to make refactored code compile — this is a type safety regression that masks errors.

7. VERIFICATION: After ALL changes, run:
   ~~~bash
   # Verify schema and functions deploy without errors (e.g., `bunx convex dev` for Convex)
   bun run test -- [your backend test directory]  # ALL backend tests still pass (e.g., `convex/__tests__/`)
   ~~~
   If ANY test fails, revert the change that caused it and find an alternative approach.

When done, message the lead with: files modified, functions extracted/shared, indexes removed, dead code removed, test results (must be 100% pass).
~~~

#### Teammate 2: "frontend-component-refactorer"
**Scope**: React components and page structure

~~~
You are refactoring frontend components for improved quality and maintainability.

CARDINAL RULE: No behavioral changes. Every existing test must still pass after your changes.

Read CLAUDE.md first. Check `./plancasting/tech-stack.md` for the `Session Language` setting. Write all findings in that language. Then read ./plancasting/_audits/refactoring/plan.md for your assigned refactoring tasks.

**Incomplete feature note**: If a shared utility is used by BOTH complete and incomplete features, STILL refactor it — only skip code exclusively used by incomplete features.

Your tasks:

1. COMPONENT DEDUPLICATION: Scan `src/components/`.
   - Identify components across different feature directories that are visually and functionally similar (e.g., different features each having their own card component, list component, or empty state component).
   - Extract shared components into the project's shared component directory (typically `src/components/ui/` or `src/components/shared/` — check CLAUDE.md for the project's convention) with configurable props.
   - Update all feature components to use the shared primitives.
   - Ensure the shared components use design tokens from the project's design token file (see CLAUDE.md Part 2 Technology Stack table or `plancasting/tech-stack.md` for the path).

2. PATTERN EXTRACTION: Identify repeated UI patterns.
   - Form patterns: if multiple features have forms with similar structure (validation, submission, error display), extract a shared form wrapper component. If a shared form HOOK is needed, document the requirement and send to Teammate 3 (hooks-and-logic-refactorer) — do NOT create hooks yourself. Document the required hook signature by appending to `./plancasting/_audits/refactoring/plan.md` (do not overwrite existing content) and notify the lead. The lead assigns hook extraction to the appropriate teammate.
   - List/table patterns: if multiple features display lists/tables with similar features (sorting, filtering, pagination), extract shared list components.
   - Modal/dialog patterns: unify modal usage across features.
   - Loading/empty/error state patterns: ensure all features use the same state components.

3. PROP INTERFACE CLEANUP: Review all component props.
   - Unify similar prop interfaces across components (e.g., if some components use `isLoading` and others use `loading`, standardize).
   - Remove unused props.
   - Add missing TypeScript types (no `any` should remain).

4. FILE ORGANIZATION:
   - Components exceeding 300 lines should be split into sub-components.
   - Ensure the `src/components/` directory structure follows CLAUDE.md conventions.
   - Move misplaced components to their correct directories.

5. DESIGN TOKEN COMPLIANCE: Verify all components use design tokens.
   - Flag any hardcoded colors, fonts, or spacing values.
   - Replace with design token references.
   - Flag any inline SVG `<path>` elements used for standard UI icons (navigation, actions, status indicators). Replace with imports from the project's icon library (see `plancasting/tech-stack.md` "Icon library" field). Inline SVGs are acceptable ONLY for product logos, brand marks, or custom illustrations.
   - Consolidate icon imports: if components import directly from the icon library package (e.g., `from 'lucide-react'`) instead of from the barrel file (`src/components/ui/icons.ts`), add the missing icons to the barrel file and update the imports to use it. This ensures the barrel file remains the canonical icon source for easy library swaps.

6. VERIFICATION: After ALL changes, run:
   ~~~bash
   bun run typecheck
   bun run test -- src/__tests__/components/  # ALL component tests pass (adapt this path to match your project's test directory structure per tech-stack.md)
   ~~~
   If ANY test fails, revert the change and find an alternative.

When done, message the lead with: components extracted/shared, patterns unified, props cleaned, test results (must be 100% pass).
~~~

#### Teammate 3: "hooks-and-logic-refactorer"
**Scope**: Custom hooks, utilities, types, and shared logic

~~~
You are refactoring hooks, utilities, and shared logic for improved quality and maintainability.

CARDINAL RULE: No behavioral changes. Every existing test must still pass after your changes.

Read CLAUDE.md first. Check `./plancasting/tech-stack.md` for the `Session Language` setting. Write all findings in that language. Then read ./plancasting/_audits/refactoring/plan.md for your assigned refactoring tasks.

**Incomplete feature note**: If a shared utility is used by BOTH complete and incomplete features, STILL refactor it — only skip code exclusively used by incomplete features.

Your tasks:

1. HOOK DEDUPLICATION: Scan `src/hooks/`.
   - Identify hooks that share similar patterns (e.g., multiple hooks that do "fetch list, handle loading, handle error, handle pagination" with only the API call differing).
   - Extract generic hooks that can be parameterized (e.g., `useBackendList`, `useBackendMutation`, or `useConvexList`/`useConvexMutation` for Convex).
   - Keep domain-specific hooks as thin wrappers over the generic ones.

2. UTILITY CONSOLIDATION: Scan `src/lib/`.
   - Identify utility functions scattered across feature files that belong in `src/lib/utils.ts`.
   - Identify duplicated formatting, validation, or transformation functions.
   - Consolidate into shared utilities with consistent naming.

3. TYPE CONSOLIDATION: Scan all TypeScript types and interfaces.
   - Identify duplicated type definitions across features.
   - Consolidate shared types into `src/lib/types.ts`.
   - Ensure all components import from the shared types file rather than defining their own.
   - Verify backend-generated types are used consistently (e.g., `Doc<>`, `Id<>` for Convex).

4. IMPORT CLEANUP: Scan all files.
   - Remove unused imports.
   - Standardize import ordering (external libraries → internal modules → relative imports).
   - Replace deep relative imports (e.g., `../../../lib/utils`) with path aliases (e.g., `@/lib/utils`). Only if the project uses TypeScript path aliases (check `tsconfig.json` or equivalent). If path aliases don't exist, consult CLAUDE.md Part 2 for the project's import convention before refactoring.

5. DEAD CODE REMOVAL:
   - Remove unused hook exports.
   - Remove unused utility functions.
   - Remove unused type definitions.
   - Remove commented-out code.

6. VERIFICATION: After ALL changes, run:
   ~~~bash
   bun run typecheck
   bun run test  # ALL tests pass
   ~~~
   If ANY test fails, revert and find an alternative.

When done, message the lead with: hooks refactored, utilities consolidated, types unified, dead code removed, test results (must be 100% pass).
~~~

#### Teammate 4: "test-and-structure-refactorer"
**Scope**: Test quality, E2E tests, and overall project structure

~~~
You are refactoring tests and project structure for improved quality and maintainability.

CARDINAL RULE: Tests must continue to validate the same behaviors. You may restructure, deduplicate, and improve tests, but you must NOT remove test coverage.

Read CLAUDE.md first. Check `./plancasting/tech-stack.md` for the `Session Language` setting. Write all findings in that language. Then read ./plancasting/_audits/refactoring/plan.md for your assigned refactoring tasks.

**Incomplete feature note**: If a shared utility is used by BOTH complete and incomplete features, STILL refactor it — only skip code exclusively used by incomplete features.

Your tasks:

1. TEST DEDUPLICATION: Scan your backend test directory (e.g., `convex/__tests__/`), `src/__tests__/`, and `e2e/`.
   - Identify duplicated test setup logic. Extract into shared test fixtures and helpers.
   - Create `src/__tests__/fixtures/` for shared mock data and test utilities.
   - Identify test files that test the same behavior from different angles — consolidate without reducing coverage.

2. TEST QUALITY: Review all test files.
   - Ensure test descriptions are clear and follow a consistent format ("should [verb] when [condition]").
   - Ensure each test tests exactly one thing (split tests that assert multiple unrelated behaviors).
   - Verify Given-When-Then structure is followed in acceptance criteria tests.
   - Add missing edge case tests identified during refactoring (adding new tests that cover previously untested behavior is acceptable during refactoring, per Critical Rule #8).

3. E2E TEST OPTIMIZATION: Review `e2e/`.
   - Identify E2E tests that overlap significantly — consolidate into comprehensive journey tests.
   - Ensure page objects or test helpers are used for repeated navigation patterns.
   - Optimize test execution time (avoid redundant setup/teardown across tests).

4. PROJECT STRUCTURE: Review overall directory structure.
   - Verify all files are in the correct directories per CLAUDE.md conventions.
   - Verify naming conventions are followed consistently across all files.
   - Ensure no circular dependencies exist (import A → B → C → A). Use `madge --circular src/` (preferred) or `dpdm` as a fallback. For framework-specific detection: Vite has `vite-plugin-circular-dependency`, Next.js can use `madge` directly. Manually review import chains for cycles if tooling is unavailable.
   - Note: ARCHITECTURE.md verification is performed by the lead in Phase 4 after all teammates complete.

5. TRACEABILITY AUDIT: Scan all files.
   - Verify every file has PRD/BRD traceability header comments.
   - Add missing traceability references where they can be confidently verified by cross-referencing the code's functionality with PRD/BRD documents. For uncertain mappings, add: `// TODO: Verify traceability — likely maps to PRD:XX-xxx but needs confirmation`.
   - Verify assumption markers (`// ⚠️ ASSUMPTION:`) are still accurate.

6. VERIFICATION: After ALL changes, run:
   ~~~bash
   bun run typecheck
   bun run test
   bun run test:e2e
   ~~~
   ALL tests must pass. Test count should be equal to or greater than baseline (you may add tests, never remove coverage).

When done, message the lead with: test helpers extracted, tests consolidated, structural fixes applied, traceability gaps fixed, final test count vs baseline.
~~~

### Phase 3: Coordination During Execution

While teammates are working:
1. Monitor progress via the shared task list.
2. Facilitate cross-team dependencies:
   - If backend-refactorer extracts a shared auth helper → notify hooks-and-logic-refactorer (hooks may call the old pattern).
   - If frontend-component-refactorer extracts shared UI components → notify hooks-and-logic-refactorer (hook return types may need to match new component props).
   - If hooks-and-logic-refactorer renames or moves a utility → notify frontend-component-refactorer and test-and-structure-refactorer (imports change).
3. **Conflict resolution**: If two teammates need to modify the same file:
   - The teammate completing first commits their changes.
   - The second teammate pauses, re-reads the affected files to incorporate the first's changes, then resumes.
   - If changes overlap in the same code block, the lead decides which teammate's approach to keep based on correctness (not who finished first).
   - Re-run `bun run typecheck && bun run test` after resolving any manual merges.
4. **Regression monitoring**: After each teammate messages completion, immediately run:
   ~~~bash
   bun run typecheck && bun run test
   ~~~
   If tests fail, notify the responsible teammate before other teammates proceed.

### Phase 4: Integration Verification

After all teammates complete:

1. Run the COMPLETE verification suite and compare to baseline:
   ~~~bash
   bun run typecheck
   bun run lint
   bun run build
   bun run test
   bun run test:e2e
   ~~~
   Compare test results to `./plancasting/_audits/refactoring/baseline-test-results.md`. The pass count must be equal to or greater than baseline. Zero regressions allowed. Fix any lint errors introduced by refactoring. Lint warnings may be documented but do not block the gate.

2. Verify no behavioral changes: The E2E test suite run in step 1 serves as behavioral verification. If E2E tests do not cover critical pages (check the test report), document the uncovered pages as technical debt. Visual verification of refactored code is performed by Stage 6V (not this stage) — do not attempt manual browser navigation here.

3. If `ARCHITECTURE.md` exists, verify it still accurately describes the codebase after refactoring. Update if module boundaries or file organization changed. If `ARCHITECTURE.md` does not exist, document any major module boundary changes in the refactoring report instead.

4. Generate `./plancasting/_audits/refactoring/report.md`:
   - **Metrics Before vs After**:
     - Total files / Total lines of code
     - Duplicated code instances eliminated
     - Shared modules created
     - Dead code removed (lines / functions)
     - Largest file (lines) before vs after
     - Unused indexes removed
   - **Changes by category**: Duplication, Abstraction, Consistency, Schema, Coupling, Dead code, File structure
   - **Test results**: Baseline vs post-refactoring (must show zero regressions)
   - **Remaining technical debt**: Issues identified but not addressed (with rationale)
   - **Recommendations**: Patterns to follow going forward to prevent re-accumulation

   ## Gate Decision
   [PASS | CONDITIONAL PASS | FAIL]
   - **PASS**: All tests pass, zero regressions, lint errors introduced by refactoring resolved, code quality metrics improved
   - **CONDITIONAL PASS**: All tests pass, minor refactoring opportunities remain documented
   - **FAIL**: Test regressions introduced, or behavioral changes detected
   Rationale: [brief explanation]

   (Use this exact `## Gate Decision` heading in the generated report — 6H parses this heading to extract gate decisions from all audit reports.)

5. Output summary: total files modified, duplications eliminated, shared modules created, dead code removed, test pass rate.

> **Stage 6F Handoff**: If schema changes were made during refactoring (e.g., renamed fields, removed tables, changed types), document them in the refactoring report § 'Schema Changes'. Stage 6F (Seed Data) reads this report and will regenerate affected seed scripts.

> **Stage 6G Handoff**: If error handling patterns were extracted during refactoring (e.g., shared `withRetry()`, `handleApiError()`, error boundary wrappers), document them in the refactoring report under an **'Extracted Error Handling Patterns for Stage 6G'** section. List each pattern with its file location and usage. Example: `- withRetry() in src/lib/api-utils.ts: wraps async operations with exponential backoff`. Stage 6G reads this section to reuse existing patterns rather than creating duplicates.

### Unfixable Violation Protocol

If a refactoring improvement requires architectural changes beyond the scope of this stage (e.g., fundamental data model restructuring, major framework migration):
1. Document it in `./plancasting/_audits/refactoring/unfixable-violations.md` with severity, description, and rationale.
2. Reference the improvement in the main report under a 'Deferred Architectural Improvements' heading.
3. Continue with the remaining refactoring tasks.

### Phase 5: Shutdown

1. Commit all changes: `git add -A && git commit -m 'refactor: Stage 6E code quality refinement'` per CLAUDE.md git conventions.
2. Request shutdown for all teammates.
3. Verify all file modifications are saved.

## Critical Rules

1. NEVER refactor and add features in the same change — refactoring must preserve behavior.
2. NEVER delete a public export without verifying zero external consumers.
3. NEVER refactor code that lacks test coverage for its external behavior — add tests first, then refactor. If only partial test coverage exists, see Phase 1 step 3 for the limited-scope approach.
4. NEVER remove database indexes without verifying all query patterns (including production query logs).
5. ALWAYS commit after each logical refactoring unit for granular rollback.
6. ALWAYS run the full test suite after every refactoring step, not just at the end.
7. If a refactoring reduces test count, it is a regression — investigate.
8. Test changes during refactoring: Adding new tests is acceptable. Restructuring or removing tests that validated implementation details (private functions, internal state) is acceptable. Changing assertions in tests that validate user-facing behavior is NOT acceptable — if such a test must change, the refactoring is introducing a behavioral change.
   **Definitions**: An *implementation detail test* validates internal mechanisms not observable by users (e.g., "internal helper returns formatted string", "state shape has specific keys", "private method called N times"). A *user-facing behavior test* validates outcomes visible to users or API consumers (e.g., "clicking Submit creates a project", "API returns 200 with user data", "error toast appears on failure", "page redirects after login"). When in doubt, ask: "Would a user notice if this assertion changed?" If yes, it's user-facing.
9. Use the commands from CLAUDE.md for testing (e.g., `bun run test`).
10. Reference Stage 5B output to avoid refactoring features that are still incomplete.
11. If a refactoring opportunity would require architectural changes beyond scope (e.g., restructuring the database schema, changing the auth model, redesigning the API contract), document it in `./plancasting/_audits/refactoring/report.md` under a "Deferred Architectural Improvements" section with the rationale, estimated effort, and recommended approach. Do NOT attempt the change — it requires a dedicated Stage 5 re-run or a new pipeline cycle.
12. If refactoring changes module boundaries, public APIs, or directory structure, update `ARCHITECTURE.md` (if it exists) to reflect the new structure.
